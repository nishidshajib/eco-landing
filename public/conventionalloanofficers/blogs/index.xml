&lt;p&gt;The quick answer most lenders will give you is 620. But that&amp;rsquo;s only part of the story, and understanding the full picture could save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-minimum-isnt-the-goal"&gt;The Minimum Isn&amp;rsquo;t the Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, 620 is typically the minimum credit score for conventional loan approval. But here&amp;rsquo;s what most people don&amp;rsquo;t realize: qualifying at 620 and getting approved with favorable terms are two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Should You Put 20% Down on a Conventional Loan? Let's Do the Math</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/should-you-put-20-down-on-a-conventional-loan-lets-do-the-math/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/should-you-put-20-down-on-a-conventional-loan-lets-do-the-math/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need 20% down to buy a house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone repeat this myth, I could probably make a down payment myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: you don&amp;rsquo;t need 20% down for a conventional loan. You can buy a home with as little as 3% down if you&amp;rsquo;re a first-time buyer, or 5% if you&amp;rsquo;re a repeat buyer. But whether you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; put down less than 20% depends on your financial situation, goals, and what else you could do with that money.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When Should You Actually Refinance Your Conventional Loan?</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/when-should-you-actually-refinance-your-conventional-loan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/when-should-you-actually-refinance-your-conventional-loan/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Refinance when rates drop 1%.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard this rule before. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, memorable, and completely oversimplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is more nuanced. Sometimes refinancing with a 0.5% rate drop makes perfect sense. Other times, even a 1.5% drop isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the hassle and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about when refinancing your conventional loan actually makes financial sense—and when you&amp;rsquo;re better off staying put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-break-even-point-is-everything"&gt;The Break-Even Point Is Everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget the 1% rule. What really matters is your break-even point: how long it takes to recoup your closing costs through the monthly payment savings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First-Time Home Buyer? Here's What Conventional Loan Officers Wish You Knew</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/first-time-home-buyer-heres-what-conventional-loan-officers-wish-you-knew/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/first-time-home-buyer-heres-what-conventional-loan-officers-wish-you-knew/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with hundreds of first-time home buyers over the years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the same misconceptions come up over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s clear the air. Here&amp;rsquo;s what loan officers actually wish first-time buyers knew before they started the home buying process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="you-dont-need-perfect-credit"&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Perfect Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-time buyers often think they need an 800 credit score to get approved. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For conventional loans, 620 is the minimum, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get competitive rates starting around 680-700. Yes, a 750+ score gets you better terms, but don&amp;rsquo;t let a 690 score stop you from applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conventional Loan Limits 2025: What You Need to Know Before You Shop</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-shop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-shop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announces new conforming loan limits for conventional mortgages. These limits determine the maximum amount you can borrow with a standard conventional loan before you cross into jumbo loan territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is &lt;strong&gt;$806,500&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most of the U.S.—up from $766,550 in 2024. But if you&amp;rsquo;re buying in a high-cost area, your limit could be significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Remove PMI from Your Conventional Loan (Without Refinancing)</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/how-to-remove-pmi-from-your-conventional-loan-without-refinancing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/how-to-remove-pmi-from-your-conventional-loan-without-refinancing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re paying Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) on your conventional loan, you&amp;rsquo;re probably throwing away $100 to $500 per month depending on your loan amount and down payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? PMI isn&amp;rsquo;t permanent. Once you reach 20% equity in your home, you can get rid of it—and you don&amp;rsquo;t always need to refinance to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show you exactly how to remove PMI and keep that money in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conventional vs. FHA Loans: Which One Actually Saves You Money?</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/conventional-vs.-fha-loans-which-one-actually-saves-you-money/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/conventional-vs.-fha-loans-which-one-actually-saves-you-money/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re deciding between a conventional loan and an FHA loan, most people focus on the down payment requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional: 3-5% down&lt;br&gt;
FHA: 3.5% down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They look pretty similar, right? So why not just go with FHA since it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;easier to qualify&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. The down payment is just one piece of the puzzle. When you factor in mortgage insurance, credit score impacts, and long-term costs, conventional loans often come out ahead—even for borrowers with less-than-perfect credit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
