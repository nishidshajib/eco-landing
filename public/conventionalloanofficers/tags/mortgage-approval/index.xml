&lt;p&gt;The quick answer most lenders will give you is 620. But that&amp;rsquo;s only part of the story, and understanding the full picture could save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-minimum-isnt-the-goal"&gt;The Minimum Isn&amp;rsquo;t the Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, 620 is typically the minimum credit score for conventional loan approval. But here&amp;rsquo;s what most people don&amp;rsquo;t realize: qualifying at 620 and getting approved with favorable terms are two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First-Time Home Buyer? Here's What Conventional Loan Officers Wish You Knew</title><link>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/first-time-home-buyer-heres-what-conventional-loan-officers-wish-you-knew/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalloanofficers.com/blogs/first-time-home-buyer-heres-what-conventional-loan-officers-wish-you-knew/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with hundreds of first-time home buyers over the years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the same misconceptions come up over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s clear the air. Here&amp;rsquo;s what loan officers actually wish first-time buyers knew before they started the home buying process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="you-dont-need-perfect-credit"&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Perfect Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-time buyers often think they need an 800 credit score to get approved. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For conventional loans, 620 is the minimum, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get competitive rates starting around 680-700. Yes, a 750+ score gets you better terms, but don&amp;rsquo;t let a 690 score stop you from applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
