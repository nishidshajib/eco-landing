&lt;p&gt;If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone repeat this myth, I could probably make a down payment myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: you don&amp;rsquo;t need 20% down for a conventional loan. You can buy a home with as little as 3% down if you&amp;rsquo;re a first-time buyer, or 5% if you&amp;rsquo;re a repeat buyer. But whether you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; put down less than 20% depends on your financial situation, goals, and what else you could do with that money.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
