&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s clear the air. Here&amp;rsquo;s what loan officers actually wish first-time buyers knew before they started the home buying process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="you-dont-need-perfect-credit"&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Perfect Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-time buyers often think they need an 800 credit score to get approved. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For conventional loans, 620 is the minimum, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get competitive rates starting around 680-700. Yes, a 750+ score gets you better terms, but don&amp;rsquo;t let a 690 score stop you from applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
