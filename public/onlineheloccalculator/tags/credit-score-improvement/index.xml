I needed $80,000 for home improvements, and my credit score was 702—not bad, definitely &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; credit territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got pre-qualified at Prime + 1.25 percent margin. At the time, Prime Rate was 8.50 percent, so my rate would be 9.75 percent. That seemed reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my mortgage broker suggested something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re 23 points from the next pricing tier. If you can get to 725, you&amp;rsquo;d qualify for Prime + 0.75 percent—that&amp;rsquo;s a 0.50 percent rate difference worth about $4,800 over the draw period on $80K.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
