Prime Rate was 6.00 percent, my margin was 1.25 percent, and I felt good about the competitive pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen months later, my rate hit 10.50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a 3.25 percentage point increase—not from my lender changing terms, but from the Federal Reserve raising rates nine times to combat inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my $95,000 HELOC balance, this meant my monthly interest cost jumped from $574 to $859—an extra $285 per month that wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my budget.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
