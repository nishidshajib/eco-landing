The monthly payments were crushing me—$1,580 just for minimums, with very little going toward principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used my HELOC to pay it all off. The interest savings were massive—$31,200 over my planned five-year payoff period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about savings. There were unexpected challenges I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate: variable rates rising after consolidation, payment discipline requirements without fixed amortization schedules, and the psychological weight of converting unsecured debt into debt secured by my home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Took $82K HELOC for Kitchen Renovation—Ended Up Using Only $64K and Here's Why That Matters</title><link>https://onlineheloccalculator.com/blogs/took-82k-heloc-for-kitchen-renovationended-up-using-only-64k-and-heres-why-that-matters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://onlineheloccalculator.com/blogs/took-82k-heloc-for-kitchen-renovationended-up-using-only-64k-and-heres-why-that-matters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I got approved for an $82,000 HELOC to fund our kitchen renovation. The contractor quoted $75,000 for the full project, and I wanted a buffer for unexpected costs that always seem to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months into the renovation, I&amp;rsquo;d only drawn $64,000 from the credit line. The project cost less than quoted, I found cheaper material alternatives, and I postponed some non-essential upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That $18,000 difference between approved credit line and actual usage saved me $3,240 in interest in the first year alone—and it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect example of why HELOC flexibility matters more than just rate comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
