The contractor quoted $75,000 for the full project, and I wanted a buffer for unexpected costs that always seem to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months into the renovation, I&amp;rsquo;d only drawn $64,000 from the credit line. The project cost less than quoted, I found cheaper material alternatives, and I postponed some non-essential upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That $18,000 difference between approved credit line and actual usage saved me $3,240 in interest in the first year alone—and it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect example of why HELOC flexibility matters more than just rate comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
