Lender B offers 6.625%. You pick Lender A because the rate is lower. Then you see total costs at closing and realize you made the wrong choice. Here&amp;rsquo;s why APR matters more than rate—and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-interest-rate-actually-means"&gt;What Interest Rate Actually Means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your interest rate is the percentage the lender charges to borrow money. It determines your monthly principal and interest payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$300,000 loan at 6.50% = $1,896/month (P&amp;amp;I)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$300,000 loan at 6.625% = $1,920/month (P&amp;amp;I)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6.50% rate saves you $24/month. Seems like an easy choice, right? Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Florida Mortgage Rate Shopping: How to Compare Lenders Without Hurting Your Credit</title><link>https://floridahomerates.com/blogs/florida-mortgage-rate-shopping-how-to-compare-lenders-without-hurting-your-credit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://floridahomerates.com/blogs/florida-mortgage-rate-shopping-how-to-compare-lenders-without-hurting-your-credit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You want to shop multiple Florida lenders to find the best rate. But you&amp;rsquo;ve heard that every credit check hurts your score. Can you compare lenders without tanking your credit? Yes—if you do it right. Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-credit-inquiries-affect-your-score"&gt;How Credit Inquiries Affect Your Score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a lender pulls your credit, it creates a &amp;ldquo;hard inquiry&amp;rdquo; on your report. Too many hard inquiries signal you&amp;rsquo;re desperate for credit, which lowers your score.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
