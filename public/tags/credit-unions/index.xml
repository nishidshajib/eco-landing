      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ask ten homeowners where they refinanced and you will get ten different answers: their current bank, a big national lender, a local credit union, an online broker, their neighbor&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. But here&amp;rsquo;s what almost none of them did: systematically compare rates across ALL these lender types to find which actually delivered the lowest total cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people refinance with whoever makes the process easiest, assuming rates are &amp;ldquo;pretty similar&amp;rdquo; across lenders. That assumption costs tens of thousands of dollars because refinance rates can vary by 0.25-0.75% between lender types—and even more within each category based on your specific credit, property, and loan characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My sister-in-law refinanced her mortgage three times in the past decade. The first time, she used Wells Fargo (her bank) and got 4.25% when the market average was 3.875%. The second time, she used a credit union and got 3.125% when the market was 3.25%—a great deal. The third time, she used a mortgage broker and got 2.625% when the market was 2.75%—the best deal of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Same borrower, similar market conditions, but three completely different experiences and outcomes. The lender type mattered more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
