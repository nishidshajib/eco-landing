      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my house in March 2023 at 7.25% interest rate. By September 2024, rates had dropped significantly—I was seeing 6.375% advertised for my credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question wasn&amp;rsquo;t whether I could refinance—it was whether I should refinance. Would the closing costs justify the monthly savings?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used a refinancing breakeven calculator to run the numbers. The result: 27-month breakeven timeline with $268 monthly savings and $7,300 estimated closing costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
