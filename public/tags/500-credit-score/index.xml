      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 500-579 credit score puts you in the &amp;ldquo;very poor&amp;rdquo; credit range according to FICO standards, and most lenders will reject your mortgage application automatically. However, FHA loans allow 500-579 scores with a 10% down payment and manual underwriting—meaning human review of your full financial picture instead of automated rejection. Thousands of borrowers with scores in this range get approved every year by working with bad credit specialists who know which FHA lenders accept manual underwriting and how to present compensating factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
