      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my first mortgage denial letter on a Tuesday afternoon in June 2024. After three weeks of document submission, income verification, and waiting for underwriting review, the conventional lender denied my application for a $295,000 purchase loan citing &amp;ldquo;insufficient credit history and credit score below minimum threshold for program guidelines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had 652 credit, $32,000 saved for down payment (10% down plus closing costs), stable $72,000 annual income, and debt-to-income ratio under 35%. On paper, I thought I was a strong borrower. The denial was crushing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
