      <description>&lt;p&gt;For ten years, I paid $625 per month on my HELOC. Interest-only payments during the draw period felt manageable—almost too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then month 121 arrived, and my payment jumped to $1,083.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The draw period ended. The repayment period began. And suddenly I had a 73% payment increase I wasn&amp;rsquo;t adequately prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew this was coming—it&amp;rsquo;s literally how HELOCs work. But understanding conceptually that payments increase is different from experiencing $458 less in your monthly budget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
