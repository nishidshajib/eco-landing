      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 30-year mortgage payment was comfortable at $1,788 per month. The 15-year mortgage payment was tight at $3,128 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a $1,340 monthly difference—75% higher payment for the 15-year option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every financial calculator I used recommended the 30-year mortgage for &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;manageable payments.&amp;rdquo; My parents advised taking the 30-year and &amp;ldquo;you can always pay extra principal if you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I ran detailed comparisons using loan calculators, modeled my actual budget, and analyzed long-term wealth implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
