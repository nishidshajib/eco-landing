      <description>&lt;p&gt;I call it the Kitchen Table DTI Summit because it sounds fancier than &amp;ldquo;everyone clear your schedules&amp;rdquo;. The ritual started when we lost a home to a buyer who responded faster to underwriting conditions. Now, every time we think about writing a conventional offer, we gather laptops, printed pay stubs, and a bowl of snacks and walk through six checkpoints. By the end of the evening, we know whether our debt-to-income ratio is ready for scrutiny, what documentation needs refreshing, and how to talk about reserves without stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
