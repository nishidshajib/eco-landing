      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-balance conventional loans&lt;/strong&gt; are conforming loans that exceed the baseline FHFA limit ($766,550 for 2025) but stay within the higher limits designated for high-cost counties—up to $1,149,825 for single-family homes. These loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting standards but require slightly stricter qualification than baseline conforming loans, including higher credit scores, additional reserves, and sometimes larger down payments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re buying in expensive metro areas like San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, or Honolulu, understanding high-balance loan limits and qualification rules is essential for accessing competitive rates without jumping to jumbo financing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
