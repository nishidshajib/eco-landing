      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announces new conforming loan limits—the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is &lt;strong&gt;$766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with high-cost areas reaching up to &lt;strong&gt;$1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding these limits by state and county is essential for determining whether you need conforming, high-balance conforming, or jumbo financing—and how your loan amount affects rate eligibility and approval odds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025 High-Balance Conventional Loans: County Map, Qualifying Rules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-balance conventional loans&lt;/strong&gt; are conforming loans that exceed the baseline FHFA limit ($766,550 for 2025) but stay within the higher limits designated for high-cost counties—up to $1,149,825 for single-family homes. These loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting standards but require slightly stricter qualification than baseline conforming loans, including higher credit scores, additional reserves, and sometimes larger down payments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re buying in expensive metro areas like San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, or Honolulu, understanding high-balance loan limits and qualification rules is essential for accessing competitive rates without jumping to jumbo financing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conforming vs. Jumbo Loans in 2025: Loan Limits, Rates, and Qualification Strategies</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/conformingloanofficers/blogs/conforming-vs.-jumbo-loans-in-2025-loan-limits-rates-and-qualification-strategies/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between &lt;strong&gt;conforming loans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jumbo loans&lt;/strong&gt; comes down to loan limits—conforming loans stay within FHFA maximums ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas), while jumbo loans exceed these limits. This distinction affects everything: interest rates, qualification requirements, down payment expectations, and long-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For buyers in expensive markets or purchasing high-value properties, understanding the conforming vs jumbo boundary is essential for securing the best possible financing terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conforming vs. Non-Conforming: How 2025 Loan Limits Shape Your Conventional Mortgage Options</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/conformingloanofficers/blogs/conforming-vs.-non-conforming-how-2025-loan-limits-shape-your-conventional-mortgage-options/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1379/conformingloanofficers/blogs/conforming-vs.-non-conforming-how-2025-loan-limits-shape-your-conventional-mortgage-options/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The distinction between &lt;strong&gt;conforming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;non-conforming&lt;/strong&gt; loans is fundamental to understanding conventional mortgage financing. Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards—including staying within FHFA loan limits ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas)—which allows them to be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises. Non-conforming loans either exceed these limits or fail to meet underwriting standards, requiring portfolio lending with stricter requirements and typically higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether your loan is conforming or non-conforming affects everything: interest rates, down payment expectations, qualification requirements, and long-term affordability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conventional Loan Limits 2025: How New Conforming Caps Shape Affordability and Opportunity</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/conformingloanofficers/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-how-new-conforming-caps-shape-affordability-and-opportunity/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1379/conformingloanofficers/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-how-new-conforming-caps-shape-affordability-and-opportunity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 conventional loan limits—set annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)—determine the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the &lt;strong&gt;baseline conforming limit is $766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with &lt;strong&gt;high-cost areas reaching up to $1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. These limits directly impact how much you can borrow at conforming rates, what homes you can afford, and whether you&amp;rsquo;ll need jumbo financing to complete your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1379/conventionalloanofficers/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-complete-guide/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1379/conventionalloanofficers/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-complete-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announces new conforming loan limits for conventional mortgages. These limits determine the maximum amount you can borrow with a standard conventional loan before you cross into jumbo loan territory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is &lt;strong&gt;$806,500&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most of the U.S.—up from $766,550 in 2024. But if you&amp;rsquo;re buying in a high-cost area, your limit could be significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
