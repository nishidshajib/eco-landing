      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a homeowner lock his refinance rate at 6.25% on Monday. By Friday, rates had dropped to 5.875%. He was stuck with the higher rate and lost $63 per month ($22,680 over the loan life) because he locked too early without understanding market timing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another borrower floated her rate for two weeks waiting for a better entry point. Rates jumped 0.5% during that time. She ended up locking at 6.75% when she could have had 6.25%—costing her $91 monthly ($32,760 over life).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what most homeowners get wrong about refinancing: they focus solely on interest rates and ignore the dozen other factors that determine whether refinancing actually saves money. I have seen countless borrowers refinance at the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; time according to rate charts, only to realize years later that they would have been better off keeping their original loan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that smart refinancing requires analyzing break-even periods, ownership timelines, opportunity costs, and your specific financial goals—not just comparing today&amp;rsquo;s rate to the rate you locked in years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
