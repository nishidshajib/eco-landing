      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cash-out refinancing creates various tax implications that homeowners must understand to maximize benefits and avoid surprises at tax time. While mortgage interest deductions remain available, rules governing deductibility changed significantly with recent tax law modifications, making it essential to understand current regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-mortgage-interest-deduction-rules&#34;&gt;Current Mortgage Interest Deduction Rules&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly altered mortgage interest deduction rules. For loans originated after December 15, 2017, you can deduct interest on mortgage debt up to $750,000 if married filing jointly, or $375,000 if single or married filing separately. This applies to your combined first and second mortgage balances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
