      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lender pre-approved me for $485,000. Their mortgage calculator showed I qualified easily with my $128,000 annual income.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled. I started looking at homes in the $460-485K range, imagining the beautiful kitchen, the finished basement, the three-car garage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But something made me pause. I decided to run my numbers through a true affordability calculator using the conservative 28/36 rule—not just the lender&amp;rsquo;s maximum qualification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result: My true affordable home price was $360,000—not $485,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I got pre-approved for a mortgage, my lender told me I qualified for a $450,000 home. I was thrilled—until I sat down with a spreadsheet and realized that buying a $450,000 home would leave me with $300 per month for groceries, gas, and everything else after paying my mortgage, car loan, student loans, and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was approved for way more house than I could comfortably afford.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;strong&gt;28/36 rule&lt;/strong&gt; comes in—a simple guideline that helps you figure out what you can actually afford based on your income and debts, not just what a lender will approve you for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
