      <description>&lt;p&gt;The VA doesn&amp;rsquo;t set a minimum credit score for VA loans—eligibility depends on military service, not your FICO score. However, &lt;strong&gt;lenders&lt;/strong&gt; impose their own credit score minimums, called overlays, and these vary dramatically. Some VA specialists approve 580 scores while major banks require 640 or higher, meaning your lender choice directly affects whether you qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding which lenders approve your credit profile—and how to strengthen your application if you&amp;rsquo;re borderline—can mean the difference between approval and denial, or between a competitive rate and an expensive one. This guide breaks down VA loan credit score requirements by lender type, explains how manual underwriting works for veterans with middle credit scores, and shows you which compensating factors can overcome lower scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Credit Score Do You Really Need for a Mortgage in 2025? Lender-by-Lender Breakdown</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A borrower called me frustrated last week: &amp;ldquo;I have a 665 credit score. Fannie Mae says they approve 620 and above for conventional loans, so why did three banks deny my application?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the credit score confusion that costs thousands of borrowers their dream homes every year. There&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong&gt;program minimum&lt;/strong&gt; (what Fannie Mae, FHA, or VA requires) and then there&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong&gt;lender minimum&lt;/strong&gt; (what each bank or broker actually approves). These two numbers can be 40-60 points apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
