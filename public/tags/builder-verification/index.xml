      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right builder is the most important decision you&amp;rsquo;ll make in your construction journey—more important than floor plans, finishes, or even financing. A great builder delivers quality work on time and on budget, communicating proactively and standing behind their work long after you move in. A bad builder creates financial nightmares, timeline disasters, quality failures, and legal battles that can destroy your dream of homeownership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet most people spend more time researching kitchen appliances than they do verifying their builder&amp;rsquo;s credentials, track record, and financial stability. They trust charming sales presentations, impressive model homes, or low initial bids without doing basic due diligence—discovering too late that their builder lacks proper licensing, carries insufficient insurance, or has a history of abandoned projects and unhappy clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Builder Financing Requirements: What Lenders Look for in Builder Credentials</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you apply for construction financing, your lender isn&amp;rsquo;t just evaluating you—they&amp;rsquo;re evaluating your builder. Construction loans carry significantly more risk than traditional mortgages because lenders are funding a home that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet, relying on your builder to complete the project on time, on budget, and to code. If your builder fails to deliver, the lender&amp;rsquo;s collateral (your partially completed home) could be worth far less than the loan amount.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
