      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent six years working inside a big bank mortgage division before moving to a regional lender, then eventually consulting for mortgage brokers. That unique perspective showed me something most borrowers never see: the pricing models are so fundamentally different that comparing &amp;ldquo;rates&amp;rdquo; between big banks, small lenders, and brokers is almost meaningless without context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A big bank quoting 6.25% and a mortgage broker quoting 6.0% for the &amp;ldquo;same&amp;rdquo; loan are actually offering completely different products with different cost structures, service models, and long-term implications. Understanding these differences is worth tens of thousands of dollars to you as a borrower—and might change which lender type you choose entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
