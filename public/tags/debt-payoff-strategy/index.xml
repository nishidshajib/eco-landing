      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I took out my 30-year mortgage in 2005, I planned to make the minimum payment for 30 years like everyone else. That&amp;rsquo;s what mortgages are—30-year commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But six months into homeownership, I ran an amortization calculator showing how much interest I would pay over the full term. The number shocked me: $470,200 in total interest on my $340,000 loan at 6.875%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would pay $810,200 total to own a $515,000 house ($340K loan + $175K down payment). Nearly $300,000 more than the purchase price in interest alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DTI Calculator Showed Me I Needed to Pay Off $8,400 Debt Before Qualifying—Here&#39;s My 4-Month Plan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used a DTI calculator and got devastating news: my debt-to-income ratio was 48%—5% above the 43% maximum most lenders allow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translation: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for a mortgage despite having good income, 20% down payment saved, and a 671 credit score. My monthly debt payments were too high relative to my income.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DTI calculator showed me exactly what I needed to do: pay off $8,400 in specific debts to drop my DTI from 48% to 38% and qualify for the $365,000 home I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Used HELOC to Pay Off $67K High-Interest Debt—Saved $31,200 in Interest But Here&#39;s What I Didn&#39;t Expect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had $67,000 in high-interest debt spread across five credit cards and two personal loans. The monthly payments were crushing me—$1,580 just for minimums, with very little going toward principal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used my HELOC to pay it all off. The interest savings were massive—$31,200 over my planned five-year payoff period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about savings. There were unexpected challenges I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate: variable rates rising after consolidation, payment discipline requirements without fixed amortization schedules, and the psychological weight of converting unsecured debt into debt secured by my home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
