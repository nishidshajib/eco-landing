      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months before I planned to apply for a mortgage, I checked my credit score and nearly gave up on buying a home. My middle credit score was 642—not terrible, but not good enough to get decent mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My loan officer told me bluntly: &amp;ldquo;At 642, you&amp;rsquo;ll pay about 1.5% more in interest than someone with a 720 score. On a $350,000 loan, that&amp;rsquo;s an extra $350 per month—$126,000 over 30 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should You Pay Off Collections Before Applying for a Mortgage?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collections on your credit report can tank your score and complicate mortgage approval, but paying them off is not always the right move. In some cases, paying old collections actually lowers your credit score temporarily by resetting the &amp;ldquo;date of last activity,&amp;rdquo; making the negative item look recent instead of aged. Understanding FHA collection rules, how different lenders treat collections, and when strategic non-payment makes sense can mean the difference between approval and denial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
