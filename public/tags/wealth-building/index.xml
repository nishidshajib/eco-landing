      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone told me to get a 15-year mortgage if I could afford the payment. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll save $200,000 in interest!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll own your home in half the time!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the responsible choice!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ran the numbers using mortgage calculators. The 15-year payment was $3,212/month. The 30-year payment was $2,432/month. That&amp;rsquo;s $780/month difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I chose the 30-year mortgage and invested the $780/month difference in index funds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, my investment portfolio has grown to $58,400 while the 15-year mortgage would have given me only $47,200 in additional home equity. Plus, I have financial flexibility the 15-year borrowers don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
