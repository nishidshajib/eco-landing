      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ask ten homeowners where they refinanced and you will get ten different answers: their current bank, a big national lender, a local credit union, an online broker, their neighbor&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. But here&amp;rsquo;s what almost none of them did: systematically compare rates across ALL these lender types to find which actually delivered the lowest total cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people refinance with whoever makes the process easiest, assuming rates are &amp;ldquo;pretty similar&amp;rdquo; across lenders. That assumption costs tens of thousands of dollars because refinance rates can vary by 0.25-0.75% between lender types—and even more within each category based on your specific credit, property, and loan characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
