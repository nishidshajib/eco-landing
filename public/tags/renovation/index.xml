      <description>&lt;p&gt;Borrowing against a home is rarely an individual choice; it ripples through everyone who depends on the property. That’s why we created a “family equity council,” a recurring meeting where every stakeholder can weigh in before draws occur. The process is deliberate, slower than an impulse decision, and incredibly freeing once the vote is locked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;prep-work-before-the-council-meets&#34;&gt;Prep work before the council meets&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We capture pre-work asynchronously so people arrive ready to discuss. Each participant completes a short survey covering priorities (“pay off debt,” “fund college,” “finish the downstairs suite”), acceptable risk, and non-negotiables. We pair those responses with a snapshot from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cash-outrefinance.com&#34; class=&#34;text-accent hover:underline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cash-OutRefinance.com&lt;/a&gt; that shows how different draw amounts affect future refinance options. Seeing the math in writing prevents the conversation from devolving into personal anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
