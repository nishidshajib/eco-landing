      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I spent months debating: &lt;strong&gt;Should we buy a spec home or custom build?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spec home:&lt;/strong&gt; Move-in ready (or nearly ready), fixed price, traditional financing, close in 30-60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom build:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose everything (floor plan, finishes, lot), construction loan complexity, 7-12 month timeline (or longer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We chose to &lt;strong&gt;custom build&lt;/strong&gt;. We wanted the perfect home, exactly as we envisioned it, with every detail our way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back 18 months later, after going through construction delays, cost overruns, financing complications, and endless decision fatigue—&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d choose a spec home&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spec Home Purchase Strategy: Buying Spec Homes vs Custom Builds with Construction Financing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When most people think about buying new construction, they imagine designing every detail from the ground up—choosing floor plans, selecting finishes, and watching their dream home come to life over months of construction. But there&amp;rsquo;s another path to new construction ownership that&amp;rsquo;s faster, often less expensive, and requires simpler financing: buying a spec home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spec homes (short for &amp;ldquo;speculative&amp;rdquo; homes) are builder-constructed houses built without a specific buyer in mind—usually move-in ready or near completion when you start shopping. Understanding the differences between spec home purchases and custom builds helps you choose the right new construction approach based on your timeline, budget, customization priorities, and financing situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
