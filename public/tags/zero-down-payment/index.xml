      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m active duty Air Force with 8 years of service, and when I started house hunting in September 2024, I assumed my VA loan benefit was automatically the best option. Zero down payment, no PMI, favorable rates for military—what could be better than that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I ran the actual numbers comparing VA 0% down versus conventional 5% down for my $340,000 home purchase in San Antonio, and the results surprised me. VA saved me money in some scenarios but not others, depending on how long I planned to keep the home and whether I factored in opportunity cost of the down payment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
