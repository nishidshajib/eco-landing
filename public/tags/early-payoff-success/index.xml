      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I took out my 30-year mortgage in 2005, I planned to make the minimum payment for 30 years like everyone else. That&amp;rsquo;s what mortgages are—30-year commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But six months into homeownership, I ran an amortization calculator showing how much interest I would pay over the full term. The number shocked me: $470,200 in total interest on my $340,000 loan at 6.875%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would pay $810,200 total to own a $515,000 house ($340K loan + $175K down payment). Nearly $300,000 more than the purchase price in interest alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
