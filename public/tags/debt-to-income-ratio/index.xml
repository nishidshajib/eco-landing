      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the gatekeeper for how much home you can buy. Florida loan officers use it to decide whether your payment fits. The good news: you can often improve DTI in weeks with the right moves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-dti-measures-and-the-simple-math&#34;&gt;What DTI measures (and the simple math)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTI is the share of your gross monthly income that goes to monthly debts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula:&lt;/strong&gt; (Total monthly debts ÷ Gross monthly income) × 100&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) determines whether lenders approve your refinance—and it&amp;rsquo;s something you can actually control. Here&amp;rsquo;s how Florida lenders calculate it and what you can do to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-dti-actually-measures&#34;&gt;What DTI Actually Measures&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTI is simple: &lt;strong&gt;total monthly debt payments ÷ gross monthly income × 100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lenders want to see how much of your income goes toward debt. Lower DTI = lower risk. Higher DTI = higher risk (or denial).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Calculated 85% CLTV HELOC at $135K Available—Bank Approved Only $98K, Here&#39;s Why</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every HELOC calculator I used said I could borrow up to $135,000 based on my home value and existing mortgage balance. The math was straightforward—85% combined loan-to-value ratio is standard, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I applied with my bank and got approved for only $98,000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a $37,000 difference between what calculators projected and what the lender actually offered—28% less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated and confused. The online calculators showed clear calculations. My home appraisal supported the value. My mortgage balance was exactly what I stated. So what went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My 43% DTI Got Approved for $385,000 Purchase - But 46% Was Denied, Here&#39;s Why</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied for a conventional purchase mortgage in September 2024 with $92,000 annual income, 708 credit score, and 10% down payment on a $385,000 home. My debt-to-income ratio was 46.2%. I was confident I would be approved—my income was strong, my credit was above the 700 threshold, and I had substantial down payment saved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The underwriter denied my application citing &amp;ldquo;debt-to-income ratio exceeds maximum allowable threshold for program guidelines without sufficient compensating factors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
