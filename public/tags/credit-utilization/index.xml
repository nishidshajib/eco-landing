      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most borrowers know that credit scores matter for mortgage approval, but they underestimate how much utilization ratios influence that score. Utilization is the percentage of available credit you are using across revolving accounts like credit cards. Lenders look at both your overall utilization and your per-card utilization when pulling your middle credit score. A single maxed-out card can drop your score enough to push you into a higher rate tier, costing thousands over the life of your loan. Here is what you need to know and how to protect your pricing before you apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, I pulled my credit score to see if I could qualify for an FHA loan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My score: 628&lt;/strong&gt; (middle score from 622, 628, 641 across three bureaus).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What my loan officer told me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;You qualify—but you&amp;rsquo;re in a gray zone. Some FHA lenders require 640+ for 3.5% down. At 628, you&amp;rsquo;ll have limited options and higher rates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My goal:&lt;/strong&gt; Improve to 680+ in 3-4 months to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Qualify with all FHA lenders (not just a few)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a lower interest rate (0.50-0.75% better)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Save $80-$120/month on mortgage payment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My result:&lt;/strong&gt; 681 credit score in 4 months (May 2024).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months before I planned to apply for a mortgage, I checked my credit score and nearly gave up on buying a home. My middle credit score was 642—not terrible, but not good enough to get decent mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My loan officer told me bluntly: &amp;ldquo;At 642, you&amp;rsquo;ll pay about 1.5% more in interest than someone with a 720 score. On a $350,000 loan, that&amp;rsquo;s an extra $350 per month—$126,000 over 30 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
