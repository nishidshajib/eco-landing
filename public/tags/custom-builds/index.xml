      <description>&lt;p&gt;When most people think about buying new construction, they imagine designing every detail from the ground up—choosing floor plans, selecting finishes, and watching their dream home come to life over months of construction. But there&amp;rsquo;s another path to new construction ownership that&amp;rsquo;s faster, often less expensive, and requires simpler financing: buying a spec home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spec homes (short for &amp;ldquo;speculative&amp;rdquo; homes) are builder-constructed houses built without a specific buyer in mind—usually move-in ready or near completion when you start shopping. Understanding the differences between spec home purchases and custom builds helps you choose the right new construction approach based on your timeline, budget, customization priorities, and financing situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
