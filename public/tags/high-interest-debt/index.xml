      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had $67,000 in high-interest debt spread across five credit cards and two personal loans. The monthly payments were crushing me—$1,580 just for minimums, with very little going toward principal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used my HELOC to pay it all off. The interest savings were massive—$31,200 over my planned five-year payoff period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about savings. There were unexpected challenges I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate: variable rates rising after consolidation, payment discipline requirements without fixed amortization schedules, and the psychological weight of converting unsecured debt into debt secured by my home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
