      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my lender told me my “middle score” was 671, I felt blindsided. I monitor my credit through two different consumer apps, and both said I was in the low 700s. What followed was an eight-week sprint to learn how middle credit scores really work, fix the items dragging mine down, and earn the rate I wanted on a conforming loan. This isn’t theory—it’s the exact roadmap I used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-1-request-the-same-data-lenders-see&#34;&gt;Week 1: Request the same data lenders see&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Auto-scores, VantageScores, and bank-provided updates are directional, not definitive. My loan officer suggested I pull a tri-merge report through a mortgage-preferred vendor so I could see every bureau line item the underwriter would analyze. The $60 fee hurt less than paying a higher rate for 30 years. Once the report arrived, I created a spreadsheet with three columns—Equifax, Experian, TransUnion—and highlighted the differences. Two medical collections showed on one bureau while the others marked them as paid. Utilization appeared at 54% on a travel card because the statement cut before my payment hit. With the real data in hand, I was able to set priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Credit Score 702 Qualified for HELOC at Prime &#43; 1.25%—Waited 4 Months to Hit 725, Got Prime &#43; 0.75% and Saved $4,800</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was ready to apply for a HELOC. I needed $80,000 for home improvements, and my credit score was 702—not bad, definitely &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; credit territory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got pre-qualified at Prime + 1.25 percent margin. At the time, Prime Rate was 8.50 percent, so my rate would be 9.75 percent. That seemed reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then my mortgage broker suggested something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re 23 points from the next pricing tier. If you can get to 725, you&amp;rsquo;d qualify for Prime + 0.75 percent—that&amp;rsquo;s a 0.50 percent rate difference worth about $4,800 over the draw period on $80K.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
