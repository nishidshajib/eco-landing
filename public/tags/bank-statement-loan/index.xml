      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve owned a digital marketing agency since 2019. My business does well—I gross around $180,000 per year as a sole proprietor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the problem: After legitimate business deductions (home office, equipment, software subscriptions, vehicle expenses, health insurance, retirement contributions), my &lt;strong&gt;taxable income on my tax returns is only $62,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I applied for a conventional mortgage in March 2024, every lender rejected me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; They use my tax return income ($62,000) to qualify me—which only approved me for $235,000 mortgage. I needed $625,000 to buy the home I wanted in my target neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
