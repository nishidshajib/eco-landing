      <description>&lt;p&gt;For ten years, I paid $625 per month on my HELOC. Interest-only payments during the draw period felt manageable—almost too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then month 121 arrived, and my payment jumped to $1,083.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The draw period ended. The repayment period began. And suddenly I had a 73% payment increase I wasn&amp;rsquo;t adequately prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew this was coming—it&amp;rsquo;s literally how HELOCs work. But understanding conceptually that payments increase is different from experiencing $458 less in your monthly budget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My cash-out refinance for debt consolidation saved me $712/month in total payments. That sounds amazing, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s what the headlines don&amp;rsquo;t tell you: &lt;strong&gt;My mortgage payment increased from $1,345 to $2,180—a $835/month jump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wait, how do I save $712/month if my mortgage increased by $835/month? And is taking on a higher mortgage payment worth eliminating high-interest debt?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete math behind my $52,000 debt consolidation through cash-out refi, including the payment tradeoff, total interest savings, credit score improvement, and whether I&amp;rsquo;d do it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
