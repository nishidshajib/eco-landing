      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I signed our builder contract in January 2023, the sales rep promised a &lt;strong&gt;7-month completion timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll be moving in by August, just in time for back-to-school!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We gave notice to our landlord, planned our move, and locked our interest rate for 9 months (with a 2-month buffer &amp;ldquo;just to be safe&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August came and went.&lt;/strong&gt; No house.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;September came and went.&lt;/strong&gt; Still no house.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;October came and went.&lt;/strong&gt; Foundation was poured, but framing hadn&amp;rsquo;t started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Custom Build Timeline Management: Managing Construction Loan Timelines and Draw Schedules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building a custom home is one of the most complex financial and logistical projects most people will ever undertake. Unlike buying an existing home where you close and move in within weeks, custom builds span months or even years—requiring you to coordinate builders, subcontractors, inspectors, lenders, and dozens of moving parts while managing a construction loan with draw schedules, interest-only payments, and rate lock expirations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poor timeline management can derail your construction financing: missed draw deadlines create builder cash flow problems, construction delays push your completion beyond rate lock expiration (forcing expensive extensions or relocks at higher rates), and budget overruns consume contingency funds that were meant to cover unexpected issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
