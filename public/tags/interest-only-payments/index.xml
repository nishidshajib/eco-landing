      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never financed construction before, one of the most confusing aspects of construction loans is the draw schedule—how lenders release money in stages rather than all at once, why you only pay interest on drawn funds during construction, and what happens if your builder needs more money than the approved draw amount for a particular stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding construction draw schedules is essential before signing builder contracts or finalizing construction financing. The draw process affects your builder&amp;rsquo;s cash flow, determines when you start making loan payments, and creates checkpoints where lender inspections verify your project is progressing as planned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
