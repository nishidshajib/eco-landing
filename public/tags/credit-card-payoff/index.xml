      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was drowning in monthly debt payments: $985 to credit cards, $425 to my auto loan, and $190 to a personal loan. That&amp;rsquo;s $1,600/month going entirely to debt—with most of it eaten by interest rather than principal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My home had $165,000 in equity. I owed $245,000 on a house worth $410,000. I knew cash-out refinance could help consolidate debt, but I needed to understand the actual math before increasing my mortgage balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I sat at my kitchen table staring at credit card statements totaling $52,000 across six cards with interest rates ranging from 18.9% to 24.5%. My minimum payments were $1,640 per month, and I was barely making progress on principal—most of each payment went straight to interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My home had appreciated significantly since purchase three years earlier. I owed $215,000 on a property now worth $380,000. That meant I had $165,000 in equity—43% equity position. A friend mentioned cash-out refinance as a debt consolidation strategy, so I started researching whether the math actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
