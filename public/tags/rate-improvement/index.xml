      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months before I planned to apply for a mortgage, I checked my credit score and nearly gave up on buying a home. My middle credit score was 642—not terrible, but not good enough to get decent mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My loan officer told me bluntly: &amp;ldquo;At 642, you&amp;rsquo;ll pay about 1.5% more in interest than someone with a 720 score. On a $350,000 loan, that&amp;rsquo;s an extra $350 per month—$126,000 over 30 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, I bought my first home with 672 credit score using an FHA loan at 6.875% interest rate. In September 2024—just 18 months later—I refinanced to conventional loan at 6.125% with 741 credit score, removing my mortgage insurance entirely and dropping my monthly payment by $287.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone told me to &amp;ldquo;wait until your credit improves before buying,&amp;rdquo; but I ran the numbers and realized buying now with suboptimal financing and refinancing later would cost me less than waiting 18 months while my rent increased and home prices continued rising in my market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
