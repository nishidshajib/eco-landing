      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you need to borrow money, you have several options available. Two popular choices are Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and personal loans. Each has distinct advantages and considerations that can make one more suitable than the other depending on your specific circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-helocs&#34;&gt;Understanding HELOCs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A HELOC is a revolving line of credit secured by your home&amp;rsquo;s equity.
