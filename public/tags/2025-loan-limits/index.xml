      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announces new conforming loan limits—the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is &lt;strong&gt;$766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with high-cost areas reaching up to &lt;strong&gt;$1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding these limits by state and county is essential for determining whether you need conforming, high-balance conforming, or jumbo financing—and how your loan amount affects rate eligibility and approval odds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 conventional loan limits—set annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)—determine the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the &lt;strong&gt;baseline conforming limit is $766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with &lt;strong&gt;high-cost areas reaching up to $1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. These limits directly impact how much you can borrow at conforming rates, what homes you can afford, and whether you&amp;rsquo;ll need jumbo financing to complete your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
