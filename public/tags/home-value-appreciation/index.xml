      <description>&lt;p&gt;My home appreciated $110,000 in just 2 years. I purchased for $395,000 in early 2022, and by early 2024 comparable sales showed $505,000 value—a 28% increase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question wasn&amp;rsquo;t whether I had equity to access. The question was: &lt;strong&gt;when should I refinance to leverage this appreciation?&lt;/strong&gt; Too early and I miss additional gains. Too late and the market plateaus or declines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tracked monthly comparable sales for 8 months watching the appreciation trajectory. I identified the optimal refinancing timing window when appreciation was still strong but showing signs of slowing—refinancing before the market peaked but after I&amp;rsquo;d captured most of the gains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
