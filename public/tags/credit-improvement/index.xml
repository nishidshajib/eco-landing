      <description>&lt;p&gt;Borrowers with bad credit (500-660 scores) often wonder whether they can improve their credit score during the mortgage shopping process without sabotaging their application. The answer is yes—but only if you avoid common mistakes that tank scores and understand the 45-day mortgage inquiry window. Strategic credit actions during pre-approval can raise your score 20-40 points and unlock better rates, while missteps like paying off collections incorrectly or opening new credit cards can destroy approval chances. This guide shows you exactly what credit moves are safe during mortgage shopping and which ones will get your application denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I started looking at homes in Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Eastside suburbs in January 2024, we quickly realized that $1.8 million was the entry point for the neighborhoods with good schools we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Income: $385,000 combined (tech industry, both W-2 employees)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Credit scores: 710 (me), 728 (wife)—lenders use lower score for qualification&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Savings: $320,000 (15% down + closing costs + reserves)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Current housing: Renting 2BR apartment at $3,200/month&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Debt: $1,850/month (two car payments $1,200, student loans $650)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key question:&lt;/strong&gt; Should we buy now with my 710 credit score, or wait 4-6 months to improve my score to 740+ for better jumbo rates?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started house hunting in March 2024, my credit score was &lt;strong&gt;618&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Renting: $1,450/month (going up to $1,595 in June—10% increase)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Savings: $12,000 (enough for 3.5% down + closing costs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Income: $58,000/year ($4,833/month gross)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Debt: $385/month (car payment $285, credit cards $100 minimums)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt; Should I buy now with my 618 credit score, or wait 3-4 months to improve my score to 660+?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What my loan officer told me:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;You qualify for FHA at 618—let&amp;rsquo;s get you out of that rent trap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I found my dream fixer-upper in March 2024, my credit score was &lt;strong&gt;628&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The property:&lt;/strong&gt; $215,000 for a 1985 colonial needing $29,000 in kitchen/bathroom updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The financing:&lt;/strong&gt; FHA 203(k) loan (only way to buy a fixer-upper with 3.5% down).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I had &lt;strong&gt;no idea&lt;/strong&gt; how much my 628 credit score would cost me in interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I discovered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My 628 score qualified me for &lt;strong&gt;Limited FHA 203(k)&lt;/strong&gt; (620+ requirement)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But I was &lt;strong&gt;12 points away&lt;/strong&gt; from Standard FHA 203(k) (640+ requirement)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;every 20 points&lt;/strong&gt; of credit improvement changed my interest rate dramatically&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the next 4 months, I improved my credit score from 628 to 692&lt;/strong&gt;—and watched my FHA 203(k) rate quotes drop from &lt;strong&gt;7.375%&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;6.125%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should You Improve Credit Before Cash-Out Refi for Debt Consolidation? I Waited 4 Months and Saved $6,800</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months ago, I was ready to pull the trigger on cash-out refinance to consolidate $52,000 in credit card and auto loan debt. My credit score was 668. The best rate I could get was 7.25%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My loan officer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.browselenders.com&#34; class=&#34;text-accent hover:underline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Browse Lenders&lt;/a&gt; suggested something unexpected: &amp;ldquo;Wait 3-4 months, improve your credit to 700+, and you&amp;rsquo;ll save thousands in interest on your debt consolidation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical. My debt was costing me $856/month in minimum payments at an average 18.5% interest rate. Why would I wait?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Waited 4 Months to Improve My Credit 38 Points - Saved $4,200 on My First Home Purchase</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started seriously looking at homes in March 2024, I was ready to apply for a mortgage immediately. I had saved $18,000 for down payment on a $285,000 home, my debt-to-income ratio was solid at 38%, and I assumed my credit score would be &amp;ldquo;good enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I checked my actual middle credit score through my lender&amp;rsquo;s pre-qualification: 657. Not terrible, but my loan officer explained I was sitting right at the edge between two different rate tiers—and waiting a few months to improve my credit could save me thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Bought My Home at 672 Credit Then Refinanced 18 Months Later at 741 - Saved $287 Per Month</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, I bought my first home with 672 credit score using an FHA loan at 6.875% interest rate. In September 2024—just 18 months later—I refinanced to conventional loan at 6.125% with 741 credit score, removing my mortgage insurance entirely and dropping my monthly payment by $287.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone told me to &amp;ldquo;wait until your credit improves before buying,&amp;rdquo; but I ran the numbers and realized buying now with suboptimal financing and refinancing later would cost me less than waiting 18 months while my rent increased and home prices continued rising in my market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
