      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between conforming and non-conforming loans is crucial for making the right mortgage decision in 2025. With updated FHFA loan limits and evolving market conditions, borrowers must navigate an increasingly complex landscape to secure the best financing for their specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-conforming-vs-non-conforming-loans&#34;&gt;Defining Conforming vs. Non-Conforming Loans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;conforming-loans-government-backed-security&#34;&gt;Conforming Loans: Government-Backed Security&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conforming loans meet specific criteria established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and are eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The distinction between &lt;strong&gt;conforming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;non-conforming&lt;/strong&gt; loans is fundamental to understanding conventional mortgage financing. Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards—including staying within FHFA loan limits ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas)—which allows them to be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises. Non-conforming loans either exceed these limits or fail to meet underwriting standards, requiring portfolio lending with stricter requirements and typically higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether your loan is conforming or non-conforming affects everything: interest rates, down payment expectations, qualification requirements, and long-term affordability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
