      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you apply for construction financing, your lender isn&amp;rsquo;t just evaluating you—they&amp;rsquo;re evaluating your builder. Construction loans carry significantly more risk than traditional mortgages because lenders are funding a home that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet, relying on your builder to complete the project on time, on budget, and to code. If your builder fails to deliver, the lender&amp;rsquo;s collateral (your partially completed home) could be worth far less than the loan amount.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
