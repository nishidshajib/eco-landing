      <description>&lt;p&gt;I almost applied for cash-out refinancing without properly evaluating my readiness. I assumed having equity was enough—but my loan officer&amp;rsquo;s 12-factor readiness checklist revealed several issues I needed to address first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three factors were borderline: my credit score was 688 (improved to 712 in 3 months), my DTI was 41% (reduced to 38%), and my employment situation needed better documentation (switched jobs 8 months prior).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking 4 months to improve my refinance readiness saved me $14,800 in interest costs&lt;/strong&gt; through better rates and qualification, plus I avoided a potential denial that would&amp;rsquo;ve tanked my credit score with a hard inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
