      <title>Inside Our Non-QM Term Sheet Lab</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our “term sheet lab” started as a Google Doc. We needed a place to compare DSCR, bank statement, and 1099 programs without losing track of who said what. Over time the doc evolved into a structured workflow with live calculators, escalation notes, and stakeholder-ready narratives. The format matters less than the discipline; when everyone reads from the same playbook, approvals arrive faster and negotiations feel calmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;gather-the-raw-ingredients&#34;&gt;Gather the raw ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lab opens with raw data: lender name, contact, timestamp, and documentation type. We stack the quotes vertically instead of side-by-side because it forces us to read each assumption slowly. Loan amount, amortization schedule, interest-only periods, prepay language, and reserve expectations appear under each lender’s header. By the time we finish typing, we already understand which quote deserves deeper analysis and which one misread the file from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
