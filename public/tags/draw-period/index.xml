      <description>&lt;p&gt;HELOC draw periods invite chaos. One minute you’re planning a roof repair, the next you’re tempted to swipe the line for a vacation “because the rate is low.” To keep ourselves honest, we run a monthly “Draw Period Budget Summit.” It’s part financial review, part therapy session, and it makes lenders look at our file like we’re the organized borrowers they want on their books. Here’s our agenda if you want to steal it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Draw periods typically last 10 years, though some lenders offer 5-year or 15-year options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
