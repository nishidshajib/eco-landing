      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend called me last week, excited about buying his first home. &amp;ldquo;I got pre-approved!&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;My bank offered 6.625% on a 30-year conventional loan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked if he&amp;rsquo;d compared rates with other lenders. Silence. Then: &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I was supposed to. I just figured my bank would give me a good deal since I&amp;rsquo;ve been with them 15 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, after comparing four additional lenders, he had offers ranging from 6.625% (his bank) down to 5.875% (a mortgage broker accessing wholesale pricing). That 0.75% difference saves him $163 per month—$58,680 over the 30-year loan. All because he spent three hours comparing lenders instead of accepting the first offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
