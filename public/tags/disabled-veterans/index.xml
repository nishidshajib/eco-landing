      <description>&lt;p&gt;The VA funding fee costs between 1.4% and 3.6% of your loan amount depending on your down payment, loan type, and whether it&amp;rsquo;s your first VA loan use. For a $400,000 purchase with zero down, that&amp;rsquo;s $5,600 to $14,400—a substantial upfront cost that gets rolled into your loan balance and increases your monthly payment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 10% or higher are &lt;strong&gt;completely exempt&lt;/strong&gt; from the VA funding fee. Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected conditions are also exempt. These exemptions can save thousands of dollars, yet many eligible veterans miss out because they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to claim the exemption or fail to provide the correct documentation to lenders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
