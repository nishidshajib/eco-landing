      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the underwriter asked for “more comfort” around my after-improved value (ARV), I realized my file still looked like a pile of emails instead of a story. I spent one long Sunday building what I now call the Rehab Appraisal Brief—a single PDF that combined comps, scope clarification, contractor proof, and credit-ready milestones. By Monday afternoon the lender cleared the valuation condition without asking another question. Here is the step-by-step walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started house hunting in 2024, every move-in ready home in my budget was either too small or in the wrong neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then my real estate agent showed me a 1972 ranch that had been sitting on the market for four months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking price:&lt;/strong&gt; $168,000 (comps were $240,000-$260,000)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The catch:&lt;/strong&gt; It needed everything—new roof, HVAC replacement, kitchen gut, bathroom remodel, flooring, and cosmetic updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated repairs:&lt;/strong&gt; $53,000&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have $220,000 in cash. But I discovered &lt;strong&gt;FHA 203(k) loans&lt;/strong&gt;—financing that rolls purchase price and renovation costs into one mortgage with just &lt;strong&gt;3.5% down&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I found a 1970s ranch house listed at &lt;strong&gt;$215,000&lt;/strong&gt; in a great neighborhood (where comparable updated homes sold for $320,000+), we knew it was a diamond in the rough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The house needed &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;: new kitchen, both bathrooms gutted, flooring throughout, updated electrical, new HVAC, and cosmetic work in every room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t have $100,000 sitting around for renovations. Traditional financing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work—no bank will give you a mortgage on a house with a non-functioning kitchen and electrical code violations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
