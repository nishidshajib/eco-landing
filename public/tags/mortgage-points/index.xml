      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started shopping for a mortgage last year, I called five different lenders on the same day to compare rates. Every single one gave me a different &amp;ldquo;rate&amp;rdquo;—ranging from 6.25% to 7.125%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was confused. Why would one lender offer me 6.25% while another quoted 7.125% for the exact same loan amount on the exact same day?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is that &amp;ldquo;the rate&amp;rdquo; you see advertised or quoted isn&amp;rsquo;t actually the full story. Understanding how mortgage rates really work—APR vs interest rate, points, credits, rate locks, and pricing adjustments—is the difference between overpaying and getting the best deal possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
