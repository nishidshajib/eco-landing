      <description>&lt;p&gt;Splitting a renovation into two phases sounds efficient until you try to align contractors, draw schedules, and mortgage timelines. Our home needed structural work first and cosmetic upgrades later, so we leaned on cash-out refinance calculators to keep the project funded without draining reserves prematurely. Here’s how the math shaped every decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-determine-total-proceeds-and-phase-allocation&#34;&gt;Step 1: Determine total proceeds and phase allocation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The equity calculator estimated $164,000 in net proceeds after payoff, closing costs, and reserves. We assigned $96,000 to Phase One (foundation repairs, electrical updates, roof) and $48,000 to Phase Two (kitchen, baths, flooring). The remaining $20,000 went into a contingency account. The calculator exported a Gantt-style table showing when each dollar would be deployed, which helped our GC sequence subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
