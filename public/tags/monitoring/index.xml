      <description>&lt;p&gt;Home value packets fall flat when credit posture tells a different story. Lenders start every review by calculating the middle credit score, then decide whether they will trust your projected value. If your credit trajectory looks unstable, the underwriter discounts even the strongest comp set. Monitoring trends in utilization, file age, and derogatory clearance keeps your valuation narrative aligned with what lending desks actually approve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Begin with a rhythm. Pull updated tri-merge data every quarter and drop the middle score into a dashboard next to your valuation worksheets. Highlight any month-to-month swings greater than ten points and annotate the cause—new accounts, balance transfers, disputes, or scorecard updates. When you can explain the movement, lenders view the variance as managed rather than risky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
