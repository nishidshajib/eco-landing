      <description>&lt;p&gt;I almost bought a $450,000 home. The real estate agent said I qualified. The lender said I could make the payments. Everyone said &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll grow into the payment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I spent 6 months using mortgage calculators and budget planning tools before making an offer. Those calculators showed me my comfortable affordability was actually $385,000—not $450,000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By waiting, optimizing my finances, and using comprehensive budget tools, I saved $47,000 in total costs and avoided financial stress that would have crushed me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
