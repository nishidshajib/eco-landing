      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pre-approval letter said $450,000 maximum. The mortgage calculator confirmed I could afford the payment—$3,600 monthly at 36% debt-to-income ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My real estate agent showed me beautiful homes in the $430K-450K range. Granite countertops, hardwood floors, finished basements, premium locations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was tempted. If the bank said I could afford $450K, why settle for less?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I ran comprehensive budget analysis beyond simple qualification. I calculated true housing costs including maintenance and utilities. I stress-tested scenarios for job loss, medical emergencies, and income disruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
