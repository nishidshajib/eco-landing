      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, the bond market woke up cranky and my floating conforming rate followed suit.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mortgage advice often falls into two camps: “Shop at least three lenders” or “Loyalty matters more than rate.” The truth sits in the middle. When I shopped for a conforming loan this summer, I wanted the transparency of multiple quotes without turning my phone into a call-center hotline. Below is the checklist I used to compare three lenders—and the lessons that helped me pick the right partner without drowning in spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
