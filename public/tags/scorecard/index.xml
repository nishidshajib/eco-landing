      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a lender for a conventional loan can feel like speed dating with spreadsheets. Everyone says they have the best rates, the friendliest processors, and the fastest turn times. We needed a way to cut through the charm and surface the facts, so we built a lender fit scorecard. The scorecard balances quantitative metrics with soft-skill signals and has become the backbone of every referral meeting we host.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-the-categories-before-filling-in-names&#34;&gt;Build the categories before filling in names&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first mistake we made was letting lenders define the agenda. Now we list the categories before the first call: pricing transparency, communication cadence, underwriting philosophy, appraisal management, and closing flexibility. Under pricing transparency we track whether the lender includes all loan-level price adjustments up front or waits until disclosures. For underwriting philosophy we note how comfortable they are handling compensating factors if appraisals come in light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
