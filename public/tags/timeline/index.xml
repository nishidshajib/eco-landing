      <title>I Ran a 14-Day Jumbo Loan Officer Selection Sprint</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most jumbo borrowers assume the right loan officer will magically appear when they email a private bank. I learned the hard way that the selection cycle matters as much as the rate sheet. My household carries income from a tech salary, venture distributions, and vesting stock, so documentation sprawl kills momentum. I decided to run a 14-day sprint to identify an officer who could keep up. Here is what I documented for every step so you can reuse the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The 48-Hour Contractor Interview Sprint That Saved My FHA 203(k) Timeline</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I assumed lining up contractors for my FHA 203(k) was the easy part—send a scope, collect a few bids, pick the friendliest voice. Then my HUD consultant reminded me that every subcontractor would be vetted by the lender, that every change would ripple through the draw schedule, and that the clock on my purchase contract did not care about anyone’s backlog. Instead of stretching the interviews across weeks, I ran an intentional 48-hour sprint. By Monday morning, I had three rehab-ready bids, a synced timeline, and a lender who called the prep “shockingly organized.” Here is the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Inspection Shock to Closing Day Confidence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/homeloanpurchase/blogs/inspection-to-closing-playbook/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Home inspections have a reputation for derailing first-time buyers. A long report lands in your inbox, the clock is ticking, and suddenly every outlet, pipe, and roof tile feels like an emergency. The truth? Most transactions survive inspection when buyers pair calm analysis with disciplined communication. Use this playbook to manage the post-inspection stretch like a pro, even if you have never read a contractor quote before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-prioritize-with-a-scoring-model&#34;&gt;Step 1: Prioritize with a scoring model&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Create a simple scoring sheet with three columns: safety, structural, and negotiation leverage. Assign each issue from the report a score from one to five in each column. Safety covers items that could harm people (exposed wiring, gas leaks). Structural addresses components that impact the home’s longevity (foundation cracks, roof damage). Negotiation leverage represents how persuasive the issue might be when asking the seller for credits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
