      <title>3% Down vs 20% Down: Which Home Purchase Strategy Actually Saves You Money?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, the conventional wisdom was simple: save 20% down to avoid PMI and get the best mortgage terms. But here&amp;rsquo;s what nobody tells you—waiting five extra years to save 20% down might cost you more money than just buying now with 3% down and paying PMI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson the hard way when I spent three years religiously saving for a 20% down payment while home prices in my market rose 8% annually. By the time I had my 20% saved, the homes I was looking at cost $80,000 more—and my &amp;ldquo;savings&amp;rdquo; on PMI was wiped out by appreciation I missed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How We Bought with 5% Down and Still Won a Multiple-Offer Battle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my partner and I decided to buy our first home, saving 20% felt impossible. We live in a high-cost market where starter homes hover near $720,000, and we didn’t want to spend another three years renting while prices climbed. Instead, we built a 5% down conforming strategy that won a multiple-offer situation and sailed through underwriting. Here’s how we did it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-budget-backwards-from-the-payment&#34;&gt;Step 1: Budget backwards from the payment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than picking a list price and hoping the payment worked, we opened a spreadsheet and reverse-engineered affordability. We entered the loan amount (95% of projected prices), current conforming rates, and estimated PMI premiums. We added taxes, insurance, HOA dues, and a buffer for maintenance. The target payment number told us the true maximum purchase price we could tolerate. That discipline prevented us from chasing homes that would have made every month feel tight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should You Put 20% Down on a Conventional Loan? Let&#39;s Do the Math</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need 20% down to buy a house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone repeat this myth, I could probably make a down payment myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: you don&amp;rsquo;t need 20% down for a conventional loan. You can buy a home with as little as 3% down if you&amp;rsquo;re a first-time buyer, or 5% if you&amp;rsquo;re a repeat buyer. But whether you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; put down less than 20% depends on your financial situation, goals, and what else you could do with that money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
