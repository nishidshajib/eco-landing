      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I decided to build our dream home three years ago, everyone warned us: &amp;ldquo;Construction is expensive, stressful, and always takes longer than you think.&amp;rdquo; They were right—but what nobody explained was how &lt;strong&gt;construction financing&lt;/strong&gt; actually works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent weeks researching construction loans, getting confused by terms like &amp;ldquo;construction-to-permanent,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;one-time close,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;draw schedules,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;interest-only payments.&amp;rdquo; By the time I figured it out, we were already under contract with a builder and scrambling to find the right financing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
