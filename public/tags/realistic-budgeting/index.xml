      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mortgage calculator said $3,400 per month. The lender confirmed my PITI payment would be $3,398. I built my budget around $3,400.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Four months after moving in, I averaged my actual monthly housing expenses. The real number was $4,115.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised by a few hundred dollars of variance. I was shocked by $715 per month of costs I hadn&amp;rsquo;t properly accounted for in my pre-purchase planning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mortgage payment was exactly what the calculator predicted. But my total housing cost was 21% higher than my budgeted amount because I focused only on PITI and ignored the other inevitable monthly expenses that come with homeownership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
