      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my kitchen remodel estimate landed at $78,000, I had two options: refinance my entire first mortgage with a conforming cash-out loan or leave the low-rate first alone and open a second lien. The obsession with “never touch a low rate” is popular on social media, but real math told a different story. Here are the six calculations that guided my decision—and the lessons any homeowner can apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-blended-rate-comparison&#34;&gt;1. Blended rate comparison&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started by writing down the current balance and rate on my first mortgage ($452,000 at 3.125%) and the quotes for potential second liens (9.5% HELOC, 10.25% home equity loan). Then I calculated the blended rate: ((First balance x first rate) + (Second balance x second rate)) / Combined balance. Keeping the first mortgage and adding a HELOC produced an effective rate of 4.62%. The conforming cash-out refinance quote landed at 6.125% for the entire balance. On the surface, keeping the first mortgage looked cheaper, but blended rates only tell part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
