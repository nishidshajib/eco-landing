      <description>&lt;p&gt;My FHA 203(k) file almost derailed before demo day because I underestimated how every trip to the hardware store would show up on my credit reports.

We hit every inspection on plan, kept the budget balanced, and unlocked the last disbursement without scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
