      <title>My Saturday Points-vs-Credits War Room</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When our lender dumped three shiny quotes into my inbox, each offer mixed points, credits, and lock periods differently. I am the spreadsheet-loving member of our household, so I spent a full Saturday turning those quotes into a points-vs-credits war room. The goal was simple: understand the true cost of each structure before locking, then explain the decision to my spouse and financial coach without jargon. Here is the framework that worked and how you can plug in your numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Locking a rate too early can cost money if markets improve; waiting too long risks payment shock. I used calculator data to determine when to lock my cash-out refinance, and the math kept me from making an emotional decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-establish-baseline-scenarios&#34;&gt;Step 1: Establish baseline scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I entered two rate quotes into the calculator: 6.5% with a 60-day lock window and 6.375% with a 45-day lock and 0.375 points. The tool compared payment, total interest, and breakeven timelines. Paying points only made sense if we locked longer than 45 days, so I leaned toward the 60-day option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
