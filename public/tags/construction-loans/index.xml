      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I decided to build our dream home three years ago, everyone warned us: &amp;ldquo;Construction is expensive, stressful, and always takes longer than you think.&amp;rdquo; They were right—but what nobody explained was how &lt;strong&gt;construction financing&lt;/strong&gt; actually works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent weeks researching construction loans, getting confused by terms like &amp;ldquo;construction-to-permanent,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;one-time close,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;draw schedules,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;interest-only payments.&amp;rdquo; By the time I figured it out, we were already under contract with a builder and scrambling to find the right financing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you apply for construction financing, your lender isn&amp;rsquo;t just evaluating you—they&amp;rsquo;re evaluating your builder. Construction loans carry significantly more risk than traditional mortgages because lenders are funding a home that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet, relying on your builder to complete the project on time, on budget, and to code. If your builder fails to deliver, the lender&amp;rsquo;s collateral (your partially completed home) could be worth far less than the loan amount.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Construction-to-Permanent Loan Guide: Complete Process from Groundbreaking to Permanent Mortgage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building your dream home from the ground up is exciting—but the financing can feel overwhelming if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand how construction-to-permanent loans actually work. Unlike traditional mortgages where you borrow once and start making payments immediately, construction-to-permanent financing structures everything differently: one closing, extended rate locks, draw-based funding, interest-only payments during the build, and automatic conversion to a traditional mortgage when construction is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re considering new construction, understanding this loan type is essential before signing builder contracts or breaking ground. Here&amp;rsquo;s everything you need to know about construction-to-permanent loans—from qualification through final conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
