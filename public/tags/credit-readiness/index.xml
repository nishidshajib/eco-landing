      <title>My 7-Day HELOC Prep Checklist</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake I made during my first HELOC attempt was assuming I could wing it. The lender asked for CLTV math, I fumbled. They wanted proof of reserves, I rummaged through email. This time around, I built a seven-day prep checklist that aligned calculators, credit steps, and lender communication. By the end of the week I had a shareable packet, a calmer household, and a green light from underwriting. Here’s the day-by-day breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Kitchen Table DTI Summit We Host Before Every Conventional Offer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I call it the Kitchen Table DTI Summit because it sounds fancier than &amp;ldquo;everyone clear your schedules&amp;rdquo;. The ritual started when we lost a home to a buyer who responded faster to underwriting conditions. Now, every time we think about writing a conventional offer, we gather laptops, printed pay stubs, and a bowl of snacks and walk through six checkpoints. By the end of the evening, we know whether our debt-to-income ratio is ready for scrutiny, what documentation needs refreshing, and how to talk about reserves without stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The week an appraiser or inspector visits is the week your HELOC story needs to sound coordinated. I used to dread those visits because we’d scramble to remember contractor invoices or plug numbers into calculators at the last second. This year we turned inspection week into a pitch rehearsal. Instead of simply tidying up the house, we rehearsed the narrative that made the HELOC make sense. Here’s how we organized the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
