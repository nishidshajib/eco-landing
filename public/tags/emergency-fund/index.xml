      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone says &amp;ldquo;put 20% down to avoid PMI.&amp;rdquo; Financial gurus preach it. Real estate agents recommend it. Lenders incentivize it with better rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when I used down payment calculators to model my specific situation, the math showed something unexpected: &lt;strong&gt;10% down with PMI was better for my financial wellness than 20% down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m paying $192/month in PMI ($23,040 over 10 years). But keeping $42,000 in liquid savings instead of putting it all toward my down payment gave me financial flexibility worth far more than the PMI cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people open HELOCs to access cash immediately—home renovations, debt consolidation, major purchases. I opened a $110,000 HELOC and never drew a single dollar from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For three years, the credit line sat at zero balance. No monthly payments, no interest charges, just $75 per year in maintenance fees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that HELOC saved me twice—not by providing cash I spent, but by providing financial security that enabled better decisions during critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
