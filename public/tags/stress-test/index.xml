      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jumbo underwriting reviews are famous for derailing strong borrowers. Between reserve requirements, concentrated stock positions, and appraisal scrutiny, even well-paid households can feel shaky. My partner and I recently closed on a $2.8 million primary residence while juggling IPO lockups and relocation reimbursements.

Use our notes to shorten your own stress cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-rebuild-the-financial-narrative&#34;&gt;1. Rebuild the financial narrative&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stopped thinking in terms of “documents” and started thinking in terms of chapters. Chapter one covered base salary, bonuses, and deferred comp. Chapter two summarized equity: RSUs, ESPP holdings, and privately held shares. Chapter three captured passive income from rentals and syndications. Each chapter opened with a one-page narrative that gave the underwriter context before they flipped through PDFs. The clarity alone removed three rounds of questions because our officer always had a cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
