      <description>&lt;p&gt;A borrower called me frustrated last week: &amp;ldquo;I have a 665 credit score. Fannie Mae says they approve 620 and above for conventional loans, so why did three banks deny my application?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the credit score confusion that costs thousands of borrowers their dream homes every year. There&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong&gt;program minimum&lt;/strong&gt; (what Fannie Mae, FHA, or VA requires) and then there&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong&gt;lender minimum&lt;/strong&gt; (what each bank or broker actually approves). These two numbers can be 40-60 points apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about buying a home or refinancing with a conventional loan, one of the first questions you&amp;rsquo;ll ask is: &amp;ldquo;What credit score do I need?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quick answer most lenders will give you is 620. But that&amp;rsquo;s only part of the story, and understanding the full picture could save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-minimum-isnt-the-goal&#34;&gt;The Minimum Isn&amp;rsquo;t the Goal&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, 620 is typically the minimum credit score for conventional loan approval. But here&amp;rsquo;s what most people don&amp;rsquo;t realize: qualifying at 620 and getting approved with favorable terms are two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First-Time Home Buyer? Here&#39;s What Conventional Loan Officers Wish You Knew</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with hundreds of first-time home buyers over the years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the same misconceptions come up over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s clear the air. Here&amp;rsquo;s what loan officers actually wish first-time buyers knew before they started the home buying process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-dont-need-perfect-credit&#34;&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Perfect Credit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First-time buyers often think they need an 800 credit score to get approved. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For conventional loans, 620 is the minimum, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get competitive rates starting around 680-700. Yes, a 750+ score gets you better terms, but don&amp;rsquo;t let a 690 score stop you from applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
