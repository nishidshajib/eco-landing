      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lender pre-approved me for $485,000. Their mortgage calculator showed I qualified easily with my $128,000 annual income.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled. I started looking at homes in the $460-485K range, imagining the beautiful kitchen, the finished basement, the three-car garage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But something made me pause. I decided to run my numbers through a true affordability calculator using the conservative 28/36 rule—not just the lender&amp;rsquo;s maximum qualification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result: My true affordable home price was $360,000—not $485,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mortgage Calculator Showed I Could Afford $450K But I Bought at $370K—Here&#39;s Why My Budget Feels Comfortable</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pre-approval letter said $450,000 maximum. The mortgage calculator confirmed I could afford the payment—$3,600 monthly at 36% debt-to-income ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My real estate agent showed me beautiful homes in the $430K-450K range. Granite countertops, hardwood floors, finished basements, premium locations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was tempted. If the bank said I could afford $450K, why settle for less?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I ran comprehensive budget analysis beyond simple qualification. I calculated true housing costs including maintenance and utilities. I stress-tested scenarios for job loss, medical emergencies, and income disruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
