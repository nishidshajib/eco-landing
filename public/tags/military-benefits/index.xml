      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Navy veteran who bought my home in 2019 with a VA loan and zero down payment, I always knew the VA loan benefit was valuable. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize was that the VA cash-out refinance program would let me access up to 90-100% of my home&amp;rsquo;s value—even though I never put a penny down originally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I used VA cash-out refinance to pull out $68,000 at 90% LTV to pay off high-interest debt and fund home improvements. Here&amp;rsquo;s exactly how it works and why it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best-kept secrets in the veteran community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m active duty Air Force with 8 years of service, and when I started house hunting in September 2024, I assumed my VA loan benefit was automatically the best option. Zero down payment, no PMI, favorable rates for military—what could be better than that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I ran the actual numbers comparing VA 0% down versus conventional 5% down for my $340,000 home purchase in San Antonio, and the results surprised me. VA saved me money in some scenarios but not others, depending on how long I planned to keep the home and whether I factored in opportunity cost of the down payment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
