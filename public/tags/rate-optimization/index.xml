      <title>I Improved My Credit from 678 to 724 Before Cash-Out Refinancing—Saved $16,900 in Total Interest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a 678 credit score and $158,000 in home equity when I started planning cash-out refinancing. My loan officer quoted me 7.25% for $85,000 cash-out at 80% LTV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he showed me something that changed everything: &lt;strong&gt;If I improved my credit to 720+, my rate would drop to 6.625%—a 0.625% difference saving $113/month or $16,900 over 5 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent 5 months strategically improving my credit from 678 to 724. When I refinanced, I got 6.625% instead of 7.25%. That 5-month delay to improve credit saved me $16,900 in interest costs—absolutely worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My 682 Credit Score Got Me 7.25% Cash-Out Rate—I Waited 5 Months to Hit 721 and Saved $11,200</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed $68,000 from my home equity for my daughter&amp;rsquo;s college tuition and some long-overdue home repairs. My home was worth $425,000, I owed $195,000, so I had $230,000 in equity—54% equity position. Cash-out refinance to 75% LTV would give me the cash I needed while maintaining healthy equity cushion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My loan officer ran initial rate quotes at my current 682 credit score: 7.25% for conventional cash-out refinance. My payment would increase from $1,340 to $1,965 per month on the new $318,750 loan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
