      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your credit score plays a pivotal role in cash-out refinancing, affecting not just approval odds but also interest rates, maximum loan amounts, and overall costs. Understanding the credit requirements for different loan programs helps you assess your readiness to refinance and identify areas for improvement if your score falls short of optimal ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;minimum-score-requirements-by-loan-type&#34;&gt;Minimum Score Requirements by Loan Type&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conventional cash-out refinances through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac typically require minimum credit scores of 620 for approval. However, this floor represents the absolute minimum, and borrowers at this level face higher interest rates, lower maximum loan-to-value ratios, and stricter scrutiny of other qualifying factors like income stability and debt-to-income ratios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
