      <description>&lt;p&gt;Florida borrowers shopping for luxury properties often misunderstand when their loan amount crosses into jumbo territory. Conforming loan limits vary significantly by county, and what qualifies as jumbo in Miami-Dade differs from what triggers high-balance requirements in Citrus County. Most buyers assume the national baseline conforming limit applies everywhere, then discover mid-transaction that their loan needs jumbo underwriting with stricter credit scores, larger reserves, and different approval timelines. Knowing your county&amp;rsquo;s limit before you start touring homes prevents surprises and positions you to work with the right lenders from day one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
