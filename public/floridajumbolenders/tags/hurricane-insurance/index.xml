      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most jumbo borrowers shopping for waterfront homes in Florida focus on purchase price, interest rates, and property taxes, then discover too late that insurance costs dwarf their expectations. A two million dollar beachfront home might carry fifteen thousand dollars a year in combined insurance premiums—wind, flood, umbrella, and homeowners—while a comparable inland luxury property costs a third as much. Lenders underwrite these insurance costs carefully because they increase your debt-to-income ratio and raise the risk that you might let coverage lapse if premiums spike after closing. Understanding what coastal insurance actually costs helps you budget accurately and avoid loan denials based on payment shock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
