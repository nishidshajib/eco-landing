&lt;h2 id="fha-loans-overview"&gt;FHA Loans: Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What FHA Loans Are:&lt;/strong&gt;
FHA (Federal Housing Administration) insured loans are backed by the federal government, meaning the government guarantees the lender against losses if you default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who FHA Loans Serve:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-time homebuyers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowers with lower credit scores (down to 580)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buyers with limited down payment savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowers recovering from past credit issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conventional-loans-overview"&gt;Conventional Loans: Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Conventional Loans Are:&lt;/strong&gt;
Conventional loans are NOT government-backed. The lender holds all risk and must sell loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to recover capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
