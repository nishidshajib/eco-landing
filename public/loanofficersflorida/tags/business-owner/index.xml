Understanding what loan officers need, how they verify income, and how to strengthen your application increases approval odds and may unlock better rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-counts-as-self-employment-income"&gt;What Counts as Self-Employment Income?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-employment includes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sole proprietors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnership income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S-corporation owners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLC members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelancers and consultants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business owners with employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each structure has different documentation requirements, but the principle is the same: proving consistent, documented income.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
