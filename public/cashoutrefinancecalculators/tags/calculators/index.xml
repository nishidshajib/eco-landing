Our home needed structural work first and cosmetic upgrades later, so we leaned on cash-out refinance calculators to keep the project funded without draining reserves prematurely. Here’s how the math shaped every decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-1-determine-total-proceeds-and-phase-allocation"&gt;Step 1: Determine total proceeds and phase allocation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equity calculator estimated $164,000 in net proceeds after payoff, closing costs, and reserves. We assigned $96,000 to Phase One (foundation repairs, electrical updates, roof) and $48,000 to Phase Two (kitchen, baths, flooring). The remaining $20,000 went into a contingency account. The calculator exported a Gantt-style table showing when each dollar would be deployed, which helped our GC sequence subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
