Instead of hoping for a number, I used an equity buffer calculator to understand how different valuations affected my proceeds. The tool guided repairs, staging, and conversations with the appraiser. Here’s the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-1-know-your-thresholds"&gt;Step 1: Know your thresholds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculator let me enter three valuation tiers: optimistic ($740,000), target ($720,000), and minimum acceptable ($700,000). It mapped each value to available proceeds after payoff and costs. The chart revealed that dropping below $705,000 would reduce net cash by $18,500—enough to threaten my renovation budget. Having that threshold helped me prioritize repairs that influence value, such as fixing soffit damage and repainting high-traffic areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
