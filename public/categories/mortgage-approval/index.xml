      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automated underwriting systems like Desktop Underwriter (Fannie Mae) and Loan Prospector (Freddie Mac) reject most bad credit applications instantly based on credit scores alone. Manual underwriting removes the automated system and assigns a human underwriter to review your full financial profile—income stability, payment history, compensating factors, and reasons for past credit issues. This process allows approval for borrowers automated systems deny, making it the primary path to homeownership for consumers with credit scores below 620.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collections on your credit report can tank your score and complicate mortgage approval, but paying them off is not always the right move. In some cases, paying old collections actually lowers your credit score temporarily by resetting the &amp;ldquo;date of last activity,&amp;rdquo; making the negative item look recent instead of aged. Understanding FHA collection rules, how different lenders treat collections, and when strategic non-payment makes sense can mean the difference between approval and denial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
