      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time we add a property to the portfolio we host what we call DSCR Rehearsal Night. It is part financial review, part theater practice. We gather everyone who touches the file—property manager, bookkeeper, loan officer, and any passive investors—then run through the numbers until we can explain them without glancing at notes. The ritual means our non-QM submissions feel as buttoned up as agency loans, even when the rent rolls are messy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
