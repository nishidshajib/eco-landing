      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cash-out refinancing feels empowering until the appraisal comes back lower than expected or a lender counters with a smaller loan amount. The disconnect almost always starts with weak benchmarking. Homeowners glance at a single online estimate, subtract a mortgage balance, and assume the difference is spendable cash. The real world includes competing valuation models, risk-based adjustments, and documentation requirements that can shrink proceeds if you are not prepared. A better approach combines three measurements—automated estimates, hyper-local comps, and lender overlays—so you never shop equity you cannot support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
