      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2026 housing landscape will reward owners who track value benchmarks like investors. Instead of waiting for headlines, calendar quarterly check-ins now so you can capture shifts before they become obvious to competing buyers or lenders. Each quarter carries a unique set of signals that informs how aggressively you can price, cash out, or negotiate repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Q1 is all about inventory velocity. As fresh listings trickle back after the holidays, monitor months of supply and pending-to-active ratios inside your valuation workbook. When absorption sharpens faster than expected, you can confidently raise your top-end pricing assumptions for spring. If inventory lingers, shift focus to interior refreshes and documentation so you stand out even in a slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
