      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I found a 1970s ranch house listed at &lt;strong&gt;$215,000&lt;/strong&gt; in a great neighborhood (where comparable updated homes sold for $320,000+), we knew it was a diamond in the rough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The house needed &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;: new kitchen, both bathrooms gutted, flooring throughout, updated electrical, new HVAC, and cosmetic work in every room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t have $100,000 sitting around for renovations. Traditional financing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work—no bank will give you a mortgage on a house with a non-functioning kitchen and electrical code violations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I decided to buy and renovate a 1980s colonial, our loan officer gave us two options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: FHA 203(k) renovation loan&lt;/strong&gt; – 3.5% down, flexible credit, government-backed&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Fannie Mae HomeStyle® renovation loan&lt;/strong&gt; – 5-20% down, slightly stricter credit, conventional loan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We chose the &lt;strong&gt;FHA 203(k)&lt;/strong&gt; because of the lower down payment (3.5% vs. 10-20%). We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a huge down payment saved, so 203(k) seemed like the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
