      <title>The Sunday Recast Dry Run That Keeps Our Conventional Refi Honest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recast sounds glamorous until you actually have to wire the lump sum and prove you understand the math. Our lender asks for a “recast readiness summary” once a quarter, so we turned the request into a standing Sunday ritual. The dry run forces us to document payments, rehearse how we would explain the cash source, and show we have a plan if markets shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-pull-the-latest-amortization-snapshot&#34;&gt;Step 1: Pull the latest amortization snapshot&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We open the amortization tab in our scenario lab spreadsheet and download the current balance, next payment, and unpaid principal portion. Then we duplicate the sheet and drop in our target principal curtailment. Watching the payment change—even slightly—makes the future recast feel real. It also arms us with a slide that shows exactly how much faster the loan would pay off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PCS Overlap Cash-Flow Map for VA Buyers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every VA buyer secretly fears the same thing: getting pinned between two sets of housing costs while PCS orders march forward. Cash gets trapped in deposits, pay periods bounce, and suddenly the underwriting call feels more stressful than deployment prep. The antidote is a cash-flow map that treats overlap months like a temporary campaign, not a chaotic surprise. Grab a whiteboard, your favorite spreadsheet, and this guide—we will walk through the same framework we coach service members on every week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
