      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misconceptions about conforming loans is that you need a 20% down payment to qualify. The reality? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer multiple pathways to homeownership with down payments as low as 3%—and understanding these options can help you buy sooner than you thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-down-payment-size-matters&#34;&gt;Why Down Payment Size Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your down payment affects three critical factors: loan approval odds, monthly payment amounts, and whether you&amp;rsquo;ll pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). But here&amp;rsquo;s what many borrowers miss: a smaller down payment doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean worse terms if you&amp;rsquo;re using a conforming loan backed by government-sponsored enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The belief that you need 20% down to buy a house. Here&amp;rsquo;s reality: over 70% of first-time buyers put down less than 10%, and many successful buyers put down as little as 0-3.5%. Understanding your real down payment options—and how to maximize them—can help you buy years sooner than you thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
