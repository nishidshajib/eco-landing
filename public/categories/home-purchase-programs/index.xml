      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started house hunting as a first-time buyer, everyone told me about FHA loans with 3.5% down. What nobody mentioned were the dozens of other programs offering grants, down payment assistance, and better loan terms than FHA—without the lifetime mortgage insurance penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered one of these programs completely by accident when a loan officer casually mentioned &amp;ldquo;HomeReady&amp;rdquo; in passing. That single conversation saved me over $40,000 in mortgage insurance costs over the life of my loan compared to FHA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
