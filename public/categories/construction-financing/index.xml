      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I signed my builder contract in March 2023, interest rates were sitting at &lt;strong&gt;6.75%&lt;/strong&gt; for construction-to-permanent loans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My lender offered me two options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Lock your rate today at 6.75%&lt;/strong&gt; for 12 months (with a float-down option if rates drop)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Float your rate&lt;/strong&gt; and lock later when your home is closer to completion&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a decision to make: &lt;strong&gt;Lock now and hope rates don&amp;rsquo;t drop?&lt;/strong&gt; Or &lt;strong&gt;float and risk rates going up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started researching construction financing for my new build, I quickly learned there are &lt;strong&gt;two main options&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Time Close)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Get a construction loan that automatically converts to a permanent mortgage when the home is finished. You close once, get one set of closing costs, and you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Two Closings)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Get a short-term construction loan to fund the build, then refinance into a permanent mortgage when construction is complete. You close twice, pay two sets of closing costs, and deal with two separate loans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Construction Loan Mistakes That Nearly Cost Me My Dream Home</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building my dream home was supposed to be exciting—and it was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it was also &lt;strong&gt;terrifying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five times during the process, I made mistakes that nearly derailed the entire project. I&amp;rsquo;m talking &lt;strong&gt;close calls&lt;/strong&gt; that could have cost me tens of thousands of dollars, delayed my closing, or even forced me to walk away from the build entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got lucky. I caught these mistakes (or someone else caught them for me) before they became disasters. But looking back, I realize how easily things could have gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
