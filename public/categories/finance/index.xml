      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cash-out refinances used to be a back-of-the-envelope idea. A borrower asked a lender, numbers were swapped over the phone, and everyone hoped the math would hold. HR leaders, finance teams, and member organizations can no longer operate like that. Equity taps intersect with balance sheet health, talent retention, and regulatory posture, so they deserve an actual governance checklist. USA Mortgage Specialist runs every request through a standardized workflow anchored by Cash-OutRefinance.com scenarios, BrowseLenders.com data, and the national intake desk. Here is the checklist we use when advising enterprise partners who want to green-light cash-out as part of their benefit or referral strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
