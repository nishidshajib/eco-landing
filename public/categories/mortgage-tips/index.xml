      <description>&lt;p&gt;Borrowers with bad credit (500-660 scores) often wonder whether they can improve their credit score during the mortgage shopping process without sabotaging their application. The answer is yes—but only if you avoid common mistakes that tank scores and understand the 45-day mortgage inquiry window. Strategic credit actions during pre-approval can raise your score 20-40 points and unlock better rates, while missteps like paying off collections incorrectly or opening new credit cards can destroy approval chances. This guide shows you exactly what credit moves are safe during mortgage shopping and which ones will get your application denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
