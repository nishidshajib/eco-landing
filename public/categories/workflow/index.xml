      <title>A Transparency Tour For Expanded-Criteria Lenders</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expanded-criteria lending thrives on clarity. Every stakeholder—borrower, lender, CPA, relocation team—needs to know exactly what is happening, why it matters, and what happens next. We call our process the “transparency tour” because it feels like walking someone through a museum exhibit: each stop has a story, a supporting artifact, and a clear takeaway. When everyone takes the same tour, the odds of a last-minute surprise drop dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;stop-1-intent--context&#34;&gt;Stop 1: Intent + context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We open with a short intent memo. It outlines loan amount, property use, target close, compensation style, liquidity sources, and unique considerations like RSU cliffs or global income. The memo lives inside the same portal where we archive lender receipts, so anyone joining midstream can get oriented in minutes. This single document saves hours of repetition because we no longer re-explain the borrower’s story every time a new underwriter or executive enters the chat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our 72-Hour Credit Refresh Mini-Sprint</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/heloclending/blogs/credit-refresh-mini-sprint/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HELOC underwriting loves to request a “quick credit refresh” at the worst possible moment. Instead of panicking, we run a 72-hour mini-sprint that syncs MiddleCreditScore.com dashboards, updated paydowns, and lender communication. The sprint has five phases—plan, pay, document, confirm, report—and it turns the lender’s last-minute ask into a calm, repeatable process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;phase-1-plan-6-hours&#34;&gt;Phase 1: Plan (6 hours)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The minute we get the refresh request, we hop into the HELOCLending calculator and MiddleCreditScore.com. We note current utilization, pending draws, and statement closing dates. Then we open the Cash-OutRefinance.com comparison sheet we already built and duplicate it for reference; if credit takes a temporary ding, we want to know whether pivoting to a cash-out refi still makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
