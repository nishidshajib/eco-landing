      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what most homeowners get wrong about refinancing: they focus solely on interest rates and ignore the dozen other factors that determine whether refinancing actually saves money. I have seen countless borrowers refinance at the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; time according to rate charts, only to realize years later that they would have been better off keeping their original loan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that smart refinancing requires analyzing break-even periods, ownership timelines, opportunity costs, and your specific financial goals—not just comparing today&amp;rsquo;s rate to the rate you locked in years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
