      <description>&lt;p&gt;Offer day arrives with adrenaline, expectations, and a swarm of notifications. For first-time buyers, that moment often reveals how fragmented their support team is. Group texts are disorganized, lenders go dark between calls, and the buyer is left translating details under pressure. A communication map resets that dynamic.

Here is how first-time buyers can collect, document, and communicate earnest money details without adding stress to already busy weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
