      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three months after moving into my beautiful new construction home, I noticed a dark stain spreading across my dining room ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I called my builder immediately, confident my warranty would cover it. The sales rep had told me, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything&amp;rsquo;s covered for at least a year—you&amp;rsquo;re fully protected!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The builder sent an inspector. His conclusion: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roof installation looks fine. This is likely condensation from your HVAC system. Not covered under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building my dream home was supposed to be exciting—and it was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it was also &lt;strong&gt;terrifying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five times during the process, I made mistakes that nearly derailed the entire project. I&amp;rsquo;m talking &lt;strong&gt;close calls&lt;/strong&gt; that could have cost me tens of thousands of dollars, delayed my closing, or even forced me to walk away from the build entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got lucky. I caught these mistakes (or someone else caught them for me) before they became disasters. But looking back, I realize how easily things could have gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
