      <title>How We Kept Our Jumbo Underwriting Review Calm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jumbo underwriting reviews are famous for derailing strong borrowers. Between reserve requirements, concentrated stock positions, and appraisal scrutiny, even well-paid households can feel shaky. My partner and I recently closed on a $2.8 million primary residence while juggling IPO lockups and relocation reimbursements. We promised ourselves the review would stay calm, so we reverse engineered the process into six checkpoints. Use our notes to shorten your own stress cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-rebuild-the-financial-narrative&#34;&gt;1. Rebuild the financial narrative&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stopped thinking in terms of “documents” and started thinking in terms of chapters. Chapter one covered base salary, bonuses, and deferred comp. Chapter two summarized equity: RSUs, ESPP holdings, and privately held shares. Chapter three captured passive income from rentals and syndications. Each chapter opened with a one-page narrative that gave the underwriter context before they flipped through PDFs. The clarity alone removed three rounds of questions because our officer always had a cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Turn Your Condition Tracker into a War Room</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every mortgage file eventually runs into conditions—small requests from underwriting that can feel enormous when you are juggling work, family, and the emotions of buying a first home. Most buyers treat those requests reactively. They dig through email threads, forward blurry screenshots, and hope the lender stops asking. Instead, treat conditions like a project sprint. Build a mini war room around them and you will clear each item faster than the processor expects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conforming Loan DTI Requirements: Understanding Debt-to-Income Ratios for 2025 Approval</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/conformingmortgageloans/blogs/conforming-loan-dti-requirements-2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is one of the most critical factors in conforming loan approval—yet it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most misunderstood. Many borrowers think they need perfect credit and massive income to qualify, when in reality, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac accept DTI ratios up to 50% with compensating factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me break down exactly how DTI works, what ratios you need for approval, and proven strategies to optimize your debt picture before applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Manual Underwriting Explained: How Bad Credit Borrowers Get Approved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/badcreditloanspecialist/blogs/manual-underwriting-explained-bad-credit-approval-2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automated underwriting systems like Desktop Underwriter (Fannie Mae) and Loan Prospector (Freddie Mac) reject most bad credit applications instantly based on credit scores alone. Manual underwriting removes the automated system and assigns a human underwriter to review your full financial profile—income stability, payment history, compensating factors, and reasons for past credit issues. This process allows approval for borrowers automated systems deny, making it the primary path to homeownership for consumers with credit scores below 620.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
