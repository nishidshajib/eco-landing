      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every mortgage file eventually runs into conditions—small requests from underwriting that can feel enormous when you are juggling work, family, and the emotions of buying a first home. Most buyers treat those requests reactively. They dig through email threads, forward blurry screenshots, and hope the lender stops asking. Instead, treat conditions like a project sprint. Build a mini war room around them and you will clear each item faster than the processor expects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
