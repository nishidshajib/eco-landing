      <description>&lt;p&gt;Borrowers with bad credit (580-660 scores) face a choice between FHA loans and subprime conventional financing. FHA allows lower credit scores (500+) and smaller down payments (3.5-10%), but requires mortgage insurance for the life of the loan on 3.5% down purchases. Subprime conventional loans start at 620 credit scores and require larger down payments (10-20%), but mortgage insurance can be removed once you reach 20% equity. Understanding which option costs less over time and fits your financial situation determines whether you save or waste thousands of dollars in unnecessary fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 conventional loan limits—set annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)—determine the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the &lt;strong&gt;baseline conforming limit is $766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with &lt;strong&gt;high-cost areas reaching up to $1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. These limits directly impact how much you can borrow at conforming rates, what homes you can afford, and whether you&amp;rsquo;ll need jumbo financing to complete your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-time homebuyers&lt;/strong&gt; often assume they need FHA loans or 20% down payments to buy a home—but conventional loans offer some of the best financing options for first-time buyers in 2025, including &lt;strong&gt;3% down payment programs&lt;/strong&gt;, competitive rates for borrowers with 620+ credit scores, and access to conforming loan limits up to $766,550 (or $1,149,825 in high-cost areas). Understanding how conventional loans work, what credit and income requirements you need to meet, and how to avoid common mistakes helps you qualify faster and save money over the life of your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
