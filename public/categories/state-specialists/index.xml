      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every national mortgage effort eventually collides with an escalation.

USA Mortgage Specialist built its escalation war room to keep tension low, evidence organized, and borrowers informed even when the stakes feel high. Use this blueprint to adapt your own version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
