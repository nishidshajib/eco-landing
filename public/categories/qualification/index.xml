      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the gatekeeper for how much home you can buy. Florida loan officers use it to decide whether your payment fits. The good news: you can often improve DTI in weeks with the right moves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-dti-measures-and-the-simple-math&#34;&gt;What DTI measures (and the simple math)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DTI is the share of your gross monthly income that goes to monthly debts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula:&lt;/strong&gt; (Total monthly debts ÷ Gross monthly income) × 100&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HELOC approval isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as having home equity—lenders evaluate credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, combined loan-to-value limits, income stability, and payment history through structured underwriting guidelines that vary significantly by lender type. Understanding these requirements before applying helps borrowers strengthen weak areas, choose appropriate lenders, and avoid unnecessary credit inquiries from lenders who won&amp;rsquo;t approve their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;minimum-credit-score-requirements-by-lender-type&#34;&gt;Minimum Credit Score Requirements by Lender Type&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Credit score minimums for HELOC approval vary widely depending on whether you apply through big banks, credit unions, online lenders, or portfolio lenders. Each lender type serves different credit tiers with corresponding rate and term adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
