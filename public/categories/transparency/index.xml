      <description>&lt;p&gt;The phrase “jumbo rate quote” sounds definitive until you compare three lenders and realize each one defines the rules differently. That is why our team treats every quote like an artifact that must be documented, challenged, and indexed for future reference. We are not trying to be difficult; we just know expanded-criteria loans come with more moving parts, more overlays, and more opportunities for mistakes. An audit-friendly process protects borrowers and helps lenders move faster because the facts are organized from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
