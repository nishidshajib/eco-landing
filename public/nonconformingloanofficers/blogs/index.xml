The weekend before our lender meeting we gathered 24 months of personal and business statements, every 1099, and the latest P&amp;amp;L. By Sunday night we had a single PDF that a non-QM underwriter could digest in minutes. Here is the exact process we ran.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DSCR Rehearsal Night With Our Investor Group</title><link>https://nonconformingloanofficers.com/blogs/dscr-rehearsal-night-with-our-investor-group/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nonconformingloanofficers.com/blogs/dscr-rehearsal-night-with-our-investor-group/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every time we add a property to the portfolio we host what we call DSCR Rehearsal Night. It is part financial review, part theater practice. We gather everyone who touches the file—property manager, bookkeeper, loan officer, and any passive investors—then run through the numbers until we can explain them without glancing at notes. The ritual means our non-QM submissions feel as buttoned up as agency loans, even when the rent rolls are messy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Our Asset Depletion Sprint Before Rate Sheets Change</title><link>https://nonconformingloanofficers.com/blogs/our-asset-depletion-sprint-before-rate-sheets-change/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nonconformingloanofficers.com/blogs/our-asset-depletion-sprint-before-rate-sheets-change/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Asset depletion loans sound simple—show enough money, get approved—but every underwriter asks the same questions about seasoning, withdrawals, and exit plans. After watching a rate sheet worsen while we hunted for a missing statement, we built a five-day sprint that keeps the entire asset story tidy. Here is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-inventory-and-intent"&gt;Day 1: Inventory and intent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with a whiteboard session listing every account we plan to use: brokerage, retirement, trust, and cash-value insurance. For each line we note ownership, recent large deposits, and whether withdrawals trigger penalties. Then we mirror that list in the overlay spreadsheet from &lt;a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank"&gt;BrowseLenders.com&lt;/a&gt;. The sheet forces us to record which lenders accept each account type and what percentage of the balance they use for qualifying income. That clarity prevents arguments later when someone insists, “But Bank X counted the whole thing last year.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
