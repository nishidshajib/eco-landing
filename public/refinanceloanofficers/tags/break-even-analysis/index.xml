&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen countless borrowers refinance based on $200/month savings without realizing they will sell their home in 18 months—before they recoup $7,000 in closing costs. They &amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo; money by losing $3,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The break-even calculation is not complicated, but most lenders conveniently avoid explaining it because it would talk people out of some refinances.

The Complete 2025 Decision Guide</title><link>https://www.refinanceloanofficers.com/blogs/when-should-you-refinance-your-mortgage-the-complete-2025-decision-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refinanceloanofficers.com/blogs/when-should-you-refinance-your-mortgage-the-complete-2025-decision-guide/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what most homeowners get wrong about refinancing: they focus solely on interest rates and ignore the dozen other factors that determine whether refinancing actually saves money. I have seen countless borrowers refinance at the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; time according to rate charts, only to realize years later that they would have been better off keeping their original loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that smart refinancing requires analyzing break-even periods, ownership timelines, opportunity costs, and your specific financial goals—not just comparing today&amp;rsquo;s rate to the rate you locked in years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
