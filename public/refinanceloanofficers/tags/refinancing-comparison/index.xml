They are not. Choosing between cash-out refinancing and a HELOC without understanding the trade-offs means paying tens of thousands more than necessary for the same equity access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have watched homeowners cash-out refinance their excellent 3.5% mortgage to a 5.5% rate just to access $40,000 in equity—costing them $72,000 in extra interest over 30 years when a HELOC would have cost $8,000. I have also seen borrowers take HELOCs with adjustable rates that skyrocketed from 4% to 9%, destroying their budgets when a fixed-rate cash-out refinance would have protected them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
