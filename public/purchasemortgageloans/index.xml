      <title>I Waited 4 Months to Improve My Credit 38 Points - Saved $4,200 on My First Home Purchase</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started seriously looking at homes in March 2024, I was ready to apply for a mortgage immediately. I had saved $18,000 for down payment on a $285,000 home, my debt-to-income ratio was solid at 38%, and I assumed my credit score would be &amp;ldquo;good enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I checked my actual middle credit score through my lender&amp;rsquo;s pre-qualification: 657. Not terrible, but my loan officer explained I was sitting right at the edge between two different rate tiers—and waiting a few months to improve my credit could save me thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FHA 3.5% Down vs. Conventional 5% Down - I Ran the Numbers for My $310,000 Purchase</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent three months comparing FHA and conventional loan options before purchasing my first home in August 2024. Every article I read said &amp;ldquo;FHA is for low credit, conventional is for high credit,&amp;rdquo; but with 668 credit score, I qualified for both programs—and the decision wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the actual math I ran on my $310,000 home purchase, comparing FHA 3.5% down versus conventional 5% down, including all the hidden costs nobody talks about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Got Denied for Conventional at 652 Credit - FHA Approved Me in 6 Days with Same Income</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my first mortgage denial letter on a Tuesday afternoon in June 2024. After three weeks of document submission, income verification, and waiting for underwriting review, the conventional lender denied my application for a $295,000 purchase loan citing &amp;ldquo;insufficient credit history and credit score below minimum threshold for program guidelines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had 652 credit, $32,000 saved for down payment (10% down plus closing costs), stable $72,000 annual income, and debt-to-income ratio under 35%. On paper, I thought I was a strong borrower. The denial was crushing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VA 0% Down vs. Conventional 5% Down - I Compared Both for My $340,000 Military Purchase</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m active duty Air Force with 8 years of service, and when I started house hunting in September 2024, I assumed my VA loan benefit was automatically the best option. Zero down payment, no PMI, favorable rates for military—what could be better than that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I ran the actual numbers comparing VA 0% down versus conventional 5% down for my $340,000 home purchase in San Antonio, and the results surprised me. VA saved me money in some scenarios but not others, depending on how long I planned to keep the home and whether I factored in opportunity cost of the down payment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Used My Parents&#39; Gift Funds for 100% of My Down Payment - Here&#39;s the Documentation Process</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I closed on my first home in October 2024 using gift funds from my parents for 100% of my down payment and most of my closing costs. Total gift amount: $14,500. My personal cash contribution: $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first told my loan officer I planned to use gift funds, she said &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s fine, we just need a gift letter.&amp;rdquo; I thought it would be simple—my parents write a letter saying they&amp;rsquo;re giving me money, transfer the funds, and we&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conventional 3% Down with PMI vs. FHA 3.5% Down - I Chose Conventional and Saved $8,400</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/purchasemortgageloans/blogs/conventional-3-percent-down-with-pmi-vs-fha-3-5-percent-down-i-chose-conventional-and-saved-8400/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started my home search in April 2024, I assumed FHA was my only option for minimal down payment. I had saved $11,500 and wanted to buy a $325,000 home—which meant 3.5% down ($11,375) would barely work with FHA, leaving me just $125 for closing costs and emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then my loan officer mentioned conventional 3% down programs. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even realized conventional allowed less than 5% down. After running the numbers comparing FHA 3.5% versus conventional 3%, I chose conventional despite it costing $64 more per month initially—because PMI removal in year 6 would save me $8,400 over 6-10 years compared to FHA&amp;rsquo;s permanent mortgage insurance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My 43% DTI Got Approved for $385,000 Purchase - But 46% Was Denied, Here&#39;s Why</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied for a conventional purchase mortgage in September 2024 with $92,000 annual income, 708 credit score, and 10% down payment on a $385,000 home. My debt-to-income ratio was 46.2%. I was confident I would be approved—my income was strong, my credit was above the 700 threshold, and I had substantial down payment saved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The underwriter denied my application citing &amp;ldquo;debt-to-income ratio exceeds maximum allowable threshold for program guidelines without sufficient compensating factors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Bought My Home at 672 Credit Then Refinanced 18 Months Later at 741 - Saved $287 Per Month</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, I bought my first home with 672 credit score using an FHA loan at 6.875% interest rate. In September 2024—just 18 months later—I refinanced to conventional loan at 6.125% with 741 credit score, removing my mortgage insurance entirely and dropping my monthly payment by $287.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone told me to &amp;ldquo;wait until your credit improves before buying,&amp;rdquo; but I ran the numbers and realized buying now with suboptimal financing and refinancing later would cost me less than waiting 18 months while my rent increased and home prices continued rising in my market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
