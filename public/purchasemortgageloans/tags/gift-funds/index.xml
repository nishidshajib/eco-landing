Total gift amount: $14,500. My personal cash contribution: $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first told my loan officer I planned to use gift funds, she said &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s fine, we just need a gift letter.&amp;rdquo; I thought it would be simple—my parents write a letter saying they&amp;rsquo;re giving me money, transfer the funds, and we&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
