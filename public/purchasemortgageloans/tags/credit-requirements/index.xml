After three weeks of document submission, income verification, and waiting for underwriting review, the conventional lender denied my application for a $295,000 purchase loan citing &amp;ldquo;insufficient credit history and credit score below minimum threshold for program guidelines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had 652 credit, $32,000 saved for down payment (10% down plus closing costs), stable $72,000 annual income, and debt-to-income ratio under 35%. On paper, I thought I was a strong borrower. The denial was crushing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My 43% DTI Got Approved for $385,000 Purchase - But 46% Was Denied, Here's Why</title><link>https://purchasemortgageloans.com/blogs/my-43-dti-got-approved-for-385000-purchase-but-46-was-denied-heres-why/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purchasemortgageloans.com/blogs/my-43-dti-got-approved-for-385000-purchase-but-46-was-denied-heres-why/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I applied for a conventional purchase mortgage in September 2024 with $92,000 annual income, 708 credit score, and 10% down payment on a $385,000 home. My debt-to-income ratio was 46.2%. I was confident I would be approved—my income was strong, my credit was above the 700 threshold, and I had substantial down payment saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underwriter denied my application citing &amp;ldquo;debt-to-income ratio exceeds maximum allowable threshold for program guidelines without sufficient compensating factors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
