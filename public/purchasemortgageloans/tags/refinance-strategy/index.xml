In September 2024—just 18 months later—I refinanced to conventional loan at 6.125% with 741 credit score, removing my mortgage insurance entirely and dropping my monthly payment by $287.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone told me to &amp;ldquo;wait until your credit improves before buying,&amp;rdquo; but I ran the numbers and realized buying now with suboptimal financing and refinancing later would cost me less than waiting 18 months while my rent increased and home prices continued rising in my market.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
