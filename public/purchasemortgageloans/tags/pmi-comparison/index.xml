I had saved $11,500 and wanted to buy a $325,000 home—which meant 3.5% down ($11,375) would barely work with FHA, leaving me just $125 for closing costs and emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my loan officer mentioned conventional 3% down programs. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even realized conventional allowed less than 5% down. After running the numbers comparing FHA 3.5% versus conventional 3%, I chose conventional despite it costing $64 more per month initially—because PMI removal in year 6 would save me $8,400 over 6-10 years compared to FHA&amp;rsquo;s permanent mortgage insurance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
