&lt;p&gt;Everyone said &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s just the cost of buying with less than 20% down.&amp;rdquo; The lender&amp;rsquo;s amortization schedule showed PMI would automatically terminate after 132 months when my loan balance reached 78% LTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total PMI I&amp;rsquo;d pay over 11 years: $31,680&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed like a waste—$31,680 thrown away with nothing to show for it. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough savings to put 20% down, so PMI seemed unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
