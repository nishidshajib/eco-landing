&lt;p&gt;The lender approved me. I was thrilled. I bought a beautiful $515,000 home with 10% down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then reality hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My actual total monthly housing cost: $4,200&lt;/strong&gt;—not $2,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t financially illiterate. I budgeted for property taxes and insurance. But I severely underestimated the hidden costs that don&amp;rsquo;t appear on mortgage calculators: maintenance, utilities, HOA fees, insurance increases, property tax hikes, and emergency repairs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
