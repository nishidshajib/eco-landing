Real estate agents recommend it. Lenders incentivize it with better rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m paying $192/month in PMI ($23,040 over 10 years). But keeping $42,000 in liquid savings instead of putting it all toward my down payment gave me financial flexibility worth far more than the PMI cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
