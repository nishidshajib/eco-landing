&lt;p&gt;I ran the numbers using mortgage calculators. The 15-year payment was $3,212/month. The 30-year payment was $2,432/month. That&amp;rsquo;s $780/month difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the 30-year mortgage and invested the $780/month difference in index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years later, my investment portfolio has grown to $58,400 while the 15-year mortgage would have given me only $47,200 in additional home equity. Plus, I have financial flexibility the 15-year borrowers don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
