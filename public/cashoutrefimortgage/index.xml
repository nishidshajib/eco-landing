      <title>FHA Cash-Out Refi at 668 Credit Score: How I Consolidated $41K in Debt and Improved My Credit to 721</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a 668 credit score—right in the middle range. Not terrible, but not great. And I had $41,000 in high-interest credit card debt at 21.6% average rate costing me $8,856/year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I applied for conventional cash-out refinance, I got denied. My credit score was below the 680 minimum most conventional lenders require.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;FHA cash-out refinance approved me at 668 credit score&lt;/strong&gt; and helped me consolidate all $41,000 debt, save $548/month, and improve my credit to 721 within 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My cash-out refinance for debt consolidation saved me $712/month in total payments. That sounds amazing, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s what the headlines don&amp;rsquo;t tell you: &lt;strong&gt;My mortgage payment increased from $1,345 to $2,180—a $835/month jump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wait, how do I save $712/month if my mortgage increased by $835/month? And is taking on a higher mortgage payment worth eliminating high-interest debt?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete math behind my $52,000 debt consolidation through cash-out refi, including the payment tradeoff, total interest savings, credit score improvement, and whether I&amp;rsquo;d do it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had $47,000 in credit card and personal loan debt at an average 19.8% interest rate costing me $9,306/year. My monthly minimum payments totaled $1,142.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I needed debt consolidation desperately. But which option? &lt;strong&gt;Cash-out refinance, HELOC, or personal consolidation loan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent three weeks analyzing all three options with actual quotes from lenders. Here&amp;rsquo;s my complete comparison including total interest costs, monthly payments, breakeven analysis, credit requirements, and which option I ultimately chose to eliminate $47K in high-interest debt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Had 3.5% Mortgage Rate—Here&#39;s Why I DIDN&#39;T Use Cash-Out Refi for Debt Consolidation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have $48,000 in high-interest credit card debt at an average 21% APR costing me $10,080/year in interest. My home has $145,000 in equity. Cash-out refinance seems like the perfect debt consolidation solution, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; At least for my situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a 3.5% mortgage rate on $265,000 borrowed in 2020. Replacing that with a 6.75% cash-out refi to consolidate debt would cost me $67,000 more in total interest over the life of the loan compared to using a HELOC at 9.5%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Debt Consolidation Cash-Out Refi Breakeven Math: When Closing Costs Make Sense vs. Keeping High-Interest Debt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cash-out refinance for debt consolidation sounds appealing: replace 18-22% credit card debt with 6-7% mortgage rates and save thousands in interest. But there&amp;rsquo;s a critical question most homeowners skip: &lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to recover closing costs through monthly savings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson when I almost made a $9,200 mistake by doing cash-out refi without understanding breakeven timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete breakeven math for debt consolidation through cash-out refinancing, including real scenarios and when it makes financial sense versus keeping high-interest debt or choosing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should You Improve Credit Before Cash-Out Refi for Debt Consolidation? I Waited 4 Months and Saved $6,800</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months ago, I was ready to pull the trigger on cash-out refinance to consolidate $52,000 in credit card and auto loan debt. My credit score was 668. The best rate I could get was 7.25%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My loan officer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.browselenders.com&#34; class=&#34;text-accent hover:underline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Browse Lenders&lt;/a&gt; suggested something unexpected: &amp;ldquo;Wait 3-4 months, improve your credit to 700+, and you&amp;rsquo;ll save thousands in interest on your debt consolidation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical. My debt was costing me $856/month in minimum payments at an average 18.5% interest rate. Why would I wait?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was drowning in monthly debt payments: $985 to credit cards, $425 to my auto loan, and $190 to a personal loan. That&amp;rsquo;s $1,600/month going entirely to debt—with most of it eaten by interest rather than principal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My home had $165,000 in equity. I owed $245,000 on a house worth $410,000. I knew cash-out refinance could help consolidate debt, but I needed to understand the actual math before increasing my mortgage balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
