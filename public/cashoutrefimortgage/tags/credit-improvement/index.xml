My credit score was 668. The best rate I could get was 7.25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My loan officer at &lt;a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank"&gt;Browse Lenders&lt;/a&gt; suggested something unexpected: &amp;ldquo;Wait 3-4 months, improve your credit to 700+, and you&amp;rsquo;ll save thousands in interest on your debt consolidation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical. My debt was costing me $856/month in minimum payments at an average 18.5% interest rate. Why would I wait?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
