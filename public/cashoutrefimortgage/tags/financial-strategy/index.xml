My home has $145,000 in equity. Cash-out refinance seems like the perfect debt consolidation solution, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; At least for my situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 3.5% mortgage rate on $265,000 borrowed in 2020. Replacing that with a 6.75% cash-out refi to consolidate debt would cost me $67,000 more in total interest over the life of the loan compared to using a HELOC at 9.5%.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
