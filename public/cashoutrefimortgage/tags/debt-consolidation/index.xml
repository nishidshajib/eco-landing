Not terrible, but not great. And I had $41,000 in high-interest credit card debt at 21.6% average rate costing me $8,856/year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I applied for conventional cash-out refinance, I got denied. My credit score was below the 680 minimum most conventional lenders require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;FHA cash-out refinance approved me at 668 credit score&lt;/strong&gt; and helped me consolidate all $41,000 debt, save $548/month, and improve my credit to 721 within 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Had 3.5% Mortgage Rate—Here's Why I DIDN'T Use Cash-Out Refi for Debt Consolidation</title><link>https://cashoutrefimortgage.com/blogs/i-had-3.5-mortgage-rateheres-why-i-didnt-use-cash-out-refi-for-debt-consolidation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashoutrefimortgage.com/blogs/i-had-3.5-mortgage-rateheres-why-i-didnt-use-cash-out-refi-for-debt-consolidation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have $48,000 in high-interest credit card debt at an average 21% APR costing me $10,080/year in interest. My home has $145,000 in equity. Cash-out refinance seems like the perfect debt consolidation solution, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; At least for my situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 3.5% mortgage rate on $265,000 borrowed in 2020. Replacing that with a 6.75% cash-out refi to consolidate debt would cost me $67,000 more in total interest over the life of the loan compared to using a HELOC at 9.5%.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Debt Consolidation Cash-Out Refi Breakeven Math: When Closing Costs Make Sense vs. Keeping High-Interest Debt</title><link>https://cashoutrefimortgage.com/blogs/debt-consolidation-cash-out-refi-breakeven-math-when-closing-costs-make-sense-vs.-keeping-high-interest-debt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashoutrefimortgage.com/blogs/debt-consolidation-cash-out-refi-breakeven-math-when-closing-costs-make-sense-vs.-keeping-high-interest-debt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cash-out refinance for debt consolidation sounds appealing: replace 18-22% credit card debt with 6-7% mortgage rates and save thousands in interest. But there&amp;rsquo;s a critical question most homeowners skip: &lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to recover closing costs through monthly savings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson when I almost made a $9,200 mistake by doing cash-out refi without understanding breakeven timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete breakeven math for debt consolidation through cash-out refinancing, including real scenarios and when it makes financial sense versus keeping high-interest debt or choosing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Should You Improve Credit Before Cash-Out Refi for Debt Consolidation?

My credit score was 668. The best rate I could get was 7.25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My loan officer at &lt;a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank"&gt;Browse Lenders&lt;/a&gt; suggested something unexpected: &amp;ldquo;Wait 3-4 months, improve your credit to 700+, and you&amp;rsquo;ll save thousands in interest on your debt consolidation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical. My debt was costing me $856/month in minimum payments at an average 18.5% interest rate. Why would I wait?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Consolidated $47,000 in Debt with Cash-Out Refi—Here's My Exact Monthly Savings Breakdown</title><link>https://cashoutrefimortgage.com/blogs/i-consolidated-47000-in-debt-with-cash-out-refiheres-my-exact-monthly-savings-breakdown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashoutrefimortgage.com/blogs/i-consolidated-47000-in-debt-with-cash-out-refiheres-my-exact-monthly-savings-breakdown/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was drowning in monthly debt payments: $985 to credit cards, $425 to my auto loan, and $190 to a personal loan. That&amp;rsquo;s $1,600/month going entirely to debt—with most of it eaten by interest rather than principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home had $165,000 in equity. I owed $245,000 on a house worth $410,000. I knew cash-out refinance could help consolidate debt, but I needed to understand the actual math before increasing my mortgage balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
