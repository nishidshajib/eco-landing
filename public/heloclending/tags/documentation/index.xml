The lender asked for CLTV math, I fumbled. They wanted proof of reserves, I rummaged through email. This time around, I built a seven-day prep checklist that aligned calculators, credit steps, and lender communication. By the end of the week I had a shareable packet, a calmer household, and a green light from underwriting. Here’s the day-by-day breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Our 30-Minute Lender Huddle Playbook</title><link>https://heloclending.com/blogs/our-30-minute-lender-huddle-playbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 16:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heloclending.com/blogs/our-30-minute-lender-huddle-playbook/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Loan officers are busy. If you wander through a HELOC update call, they tune out. I learned that after a rambling conversation last spring where I forgot half the numbers. This time we built a 30-minute “lender huddle” playbook. Every agenda item referenced Cash-OutRefinance.com comparisons, MiddleCreditScore.com updates, and BrowseLenders.com overlays. The calls became efficient, respectful, and—dare I say—fun. Here’s the template we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-1-send-the-briefing-24-hours-before-the-call"&gt;Step 1: Send the briefing 24 hours before the call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We email a short PDF titled “HELOC Readiness Brief – Week 4.” It contains:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Our 72-Hour Credit Refresh Mini-Sprint</title><link>https://heloclending.com/blogs/our-72-hour-credit-refresh-mini-sprint/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 07:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heloclending.com/blogs/our-72-hour-credit-refresh-mini-sprint/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;HELOC underwriting loves to request a “quick credit refresh” at the worst possible moment. Instead of panicking, we run a 72-hour mini-sprint that syncs MiddleCreditScore.com dashboards, updated paydowns, and lender communication. The sprint has five phases—plan, pay, document, confirm, report—and it turns the lender’s last-minute ask into a calm, repeatable process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="phase-1-plan-6-hours"&gt;Phase 1: Plan (6 hours)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute we get the refresh request, we hop into the HELOCLending calculator and MiddleCreditScore.com. We note current utilization, pending draws, and statement closing dates. Then we open the Cash-OutRefinance.com comparison sheet we already built and duplicate it for reference; if credit takes a temporary ding, we want to know whether pivoting to a cash-out refi still makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
