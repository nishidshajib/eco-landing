FHA allows lower credit scores (500+) and smaller down payments (3.5-10%), but requires mortgage insurance for the life of the loan on 3.5% down purchases. Subprime conventional loans start at 620 credit scores and require larger down payments (10-20%), but mortgage insurance can be removed once you reach 20% equity. Understanding which option costs less over time and fits your financial situation determines whether you save or waste thousands of dollars in unnecessary fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
