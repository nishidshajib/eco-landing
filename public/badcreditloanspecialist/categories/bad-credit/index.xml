The answer is yes—but only if you avoid common mistakes that tank scores and understand the 45-day mortgage inquiry window. Strategic credit actions during pre-approval can raise your score 20-40 points and unlock better rates, while missteps like paying off collections incorrectly or opening new credit cards can destroy approval chances. This guide shows you exactly what credit moves are safe during mortgage shopping and which ones will get your application denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FHA vs. Subprime Conventional Loans: Which Is Better for Bad Credit in 2025?</title><link>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/fha-vs.-subprime-conventional-loans-which-is-better-for-bad-credit-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/fha-vs.-subprime-conventional-loans-which-is-better-for-bad-credit-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Borrowers with bad credit (580-660 scores) face a choice between FHA loans and subprime conventional financing. FHA allows lower credit scores (500+) and smaller down payments (3.5-10%), but requires mortgage insurance for the life of the loan on 3.5% down purchases. Subprime conventional loans start at 620 credit scores and require larger down payments (10-20%), but mortgage insurance can be removed once you reach 20% equity. Understanding which option costs less over time and fits your financial situation determines whether you save or waste thousands of dollars in unnecessary fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Long After Bankruptcy Can You Get a Mortgage? 2025 Waiting Periods</title><link>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/how-long-after-bankruptcy-can-you-get-a-mortgage-2025-waiting-periods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/how-long-after-bankruptcy-can-you-get-a-mortgage-2025-waiting-periods/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy devastates your credit score and makes traditional mortgage approval impossible immediately after discharge. However, waiting periods are shorter than most people realize—FHA requires only 2 years after Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and some non-QM lenders approve as soon as 12 months post-discharge with compensating factors. Understanding the specific waiting periods for each loan type, how to rebuild credit strategically during the waiting period, and which lenders approve post-bankruptcy borrowers helps you return to homeownership faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manual Underwriting Explained: How Bad Credit Borrowers Get Approved</title><link>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/manual-underwriting-explained-how-bad-credit-borrowers-get-approved/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/manual-underwriting-explained-how-bad-credit-borrowers-get-approved/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Automated underwriting systems like Desktop Underwriter (Fannie Mae) and Loan Prospector (Freddie Mac) reject most bad credit applications instantly based on credit scores alone. Manual underwriting removes the automated system and assigns a human underwriter to review your full financial profile—income stability, payment history, compensating factors, and reasons for past credit issues. This process allows approval for borrowers automated systems deny, making it the primary path to homeownership for consumers with credit scores below 620.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Should You Pay Off Collections Before Applying for a Mortgage?</title><link>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/should-you-pay-off-collections-before-applying-for-a-mortgage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/should-you-pay-off-collections-before-applying-for-a-mortgage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Collections on your credit report can tank your score and complicate mortgage approval, but paying them off is not always the right move. In some cases, paying old collections actually lowers your credit score temporarily by resetting the &amp;ldquo;date of last activity,&amp;rdquo; making the negative item look recent instead of aged. Understanding FHA collection rules, how different lenders treat collections, and when strategic non-payment makes sense can mean the difference between approval and denial.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Get a Mortgage with a 500-579 Credit Score in 2025</title><link>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/how-to-get-a-mortgage-with-a-500-579-credit-score-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.badcreditloanspecialist.com/blogs/how-to-get-a-mortgage-with-a-500-579-credit-score-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A 500-579 credit score puts you in the &amp;ldquo;very poor&amp;rdquo; credit range according to FICO standards, and most lenders will reject your mortgage application automatically. However, FHA loans allow 500-579 scores with a 10% down payment and manual underwriting—meaning human review of your full financial picture instead of automated rejection. Thousands of borrowers with scores in this range get approved every year by working with bad credit specialists who know which FHA lenders accept manual underwriting and how to present compensating factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
