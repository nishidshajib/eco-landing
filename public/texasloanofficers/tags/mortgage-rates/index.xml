&lt;p&gt;A rate lock is a lender agreement freezing your interest rate for 30-45 days during underwriting. Once locked, daily market rate changes don&amp;rsquo;t affect your mortgage—you keep your locked rate regardless of market movement. Understanding rate locks and timing your lock strategically can save $10,000-$30,000 in total interest costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refinancing replaces your current mortgage with a new loan at different terms. Homeowners refinance to lower interest rates, tap home equity, shorten loan terms, or switch from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages. However, refinancing comes with closing costs that must be justified by long-term savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas loan officers help you analyze whether refinancing improves your financial situation or wastes money on unnecessary closing costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
