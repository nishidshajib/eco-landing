Banks process these applications as submitted and deny them within weeks.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rate-locking-strategy---how-texas-loan-officers-time-your-lock-for-maximum-savings&#34;&gt;Rate Locking Strategy - How Texas Loan Officers Time Your Lock for Maximum Savings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A rate lock is a lender agreement freezing your interest rate for 30-45 days during underwriting. Once locked, daily market rate changes don&amp;rsquo;t affect your mortgage—you keep your locked rate regardless of market movement. Understanding rate locks and timing your lock strategically can save $10,000-$30,000 in total interest costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-rate-lock&#34;&gt;What Is a Rate Lock?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you apply for a mortgage, lenders quote &amp;ldquo;floating rates&amp;rdquo;—rates that change daily based on market conditions. A rate lock freezes your quoted rate for a specified period (typically 30-45 days).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Homeowners refinance to lower interest rates, tap home equity, shorten loan terms, or switch from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages. However, refinancing comes with closing costs that must be justified by long-term savings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Texas loan officers help you analyze whether refinancing improves your financial situation or wastes money on unnecessary closing costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
