Appraisers and underwriters want clean documentation that ties dollars spent to market reaction. Building a renovation packet in real time prevents last-minute scrambles and gives you leverage when you negotiate purchase offers, cash-out terms, or relocation credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by logging every project in a single spreadsheet the moment you sign a contract or buy supplies. Include columns for project scope, square footage impacted, contractor contact information, permit numbers, and before/after photos stored in a shared drive. This log becomes your table of contents, guiding anyone who reviews the packet to the right evidence within seconds. Add a notes column that explains whether the improvement was health and safety related, an efficiency upgrade, or a purely aesthetic refresh—lenders weigh those categories differently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
