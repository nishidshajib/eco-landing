Appraisers and underwriters want clean documentation that ties dollars spent to market reaction. Building a renovation packet in real time prevents last-minute scrambles and gives you leverage when you negotiate purchase offers, cash-out terms, or relocation credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by logging every project in a single spreadsheet the moment you sign a contract or buy supplies. Include columns for project scope, square footage impacted, contractor contact information, permit numbers, and before/after photos stored in a shared drive. This log becomes your table of contents, guiding anyone who reviews the packet to the right evidence within seconds. Add a notes column that explains whether the improvement was health and safety related, an efficiency upgrade, or a purely aesthetic refresh—lenders weigh those categories differently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Run a DIY Annual Home Value Audit</title><link>https://onlinevaluecalculator.com/blogs/run-a-diy-annual-home-value-audit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://onlinevaluecalculator.com/blogs/run-a-diy-annual-home-value-audit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Most homeowners only think about property value when they list or refinance. By then, the clock is ticking, paperwork is scattered, and deferred maintenance suddenly feels urgent. A yearly home value audit flips that script. Spending a weekend reviewing data, documentation, and property condition keeps you equity-ready all year. Lenders, agents, and buyers respond quickly when you show that your numbers are current and your home is cared for. Here is a structured audit you can follow every twelve months—or after major improvements—for a calmer, data-driven approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
