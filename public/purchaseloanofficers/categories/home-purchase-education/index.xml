Every single one gave me a different &amp;ldquo;rate&amp;rdquo;—ranging from 6.25% to 7.125%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was confused. Why would one lender offer me 6.25% while another quoted 7.125% for the exact same loan amount on the exact same day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that &amp;ldquo;the rate&amp;rdquo; you see advertised or quoted isn&amp;rsquo;t actually the full story. Understanding how mortgage rates really work—APR vs interest rate, points, credits, rate locks, and pricing adjustments—is the difference between overpaying and getting the best deal possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Nobody Tells You About Closing Costs Until You're Already Under Contract</title><link>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/what-nobody-tells-you-about-closing-costs-until-youre-already-under-contract/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/what-nobody-tells-you-about-closing-costs-until-youre-already-under-contract/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Three days before my closing, I got the final Closing Disclosure from my lender. I expected to pay around $8,000 in closing costs based on the Loan Estimate I received weeks earlier. The actual number? &lt;strong&gt;$12,347.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned. Where did the extra $4,347 come from? And why didn&amp;rsquo;t anyone warn me about these costs earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After furiously Googling, calling my lender, and negotiating with vendors, I managed to reduce my closing costs by $2,100—but I still paid more than I expected. Looking back, I realize I could have saved even more if I&amp;rsquo;d known what to look for and what to negotiate from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
