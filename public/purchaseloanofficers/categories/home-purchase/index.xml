I filled out a five-minute online form, got a number, and started touring homes. Two weeks later, I found the perfect place—and my offer was rejected in favor of a buyer who had &amp;ldquo;pre-approval.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s when I learned the hard lesson: &lt;strong&gt;pre-qualification and pre-approval are not the same thing&lt;/strong&gt;, and in competitive markets, only one of them actually matters to sellers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>3% Down vs 20% Down: Which Home Purchase Strategy Actually Saves You Money?</title><link>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/3-down-vs-20-down-which-home-purchase-strategy-actually-saves-you-money/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/3-down-vs-20-down-which-home-purchase-strategy-actually-saves-you-money/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For years, the conventional wisdom was simple: save 20% down to avoid PMI and get the best mortgage terms.

&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson the hard way when I spent three years religiously saving for a 20% down payment while home prices in my market rose 8% annually. By the time I had my 20% saved, the homes I was looking at cost $80,000 more—and my &amp;ldquo;savings&amp;rdquo; on PMI was wiped out by appreciation I missed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
