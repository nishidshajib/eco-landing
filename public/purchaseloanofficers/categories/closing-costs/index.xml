I expected to pay around $8,000 in closing costs based on the Loan Estimate I received weeks earlier. The actual number? &lt;strong&gt;$12,347.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned. Where did the extra $4,347 come from? And why didn&amp;rsquo;t anyone warn me about these costs earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After furiously Googling, calling my lender, and negotiating with vendors, I managed to reduce my closing costs by $2,100—but I still paid more than I expected. Looking back, I realize I could have saved even more if I&amp;rsquo;d known what to look for and what to negotiate from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
