My middle credit score was 642—not terrible, but not good enough to get decent mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My loan officer told me bluntly: &amp;ldquo;At 642, you&amp;rsquo;ll pay about 1.5% more in interest than someone with a 720 score. On a $350,000 loan, that&amp;rsquo;s an extra $350 per month—$126,000 over 30 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
