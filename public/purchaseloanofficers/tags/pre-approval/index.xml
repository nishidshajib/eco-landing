I filled out a five-minute online form, got a number, and started touring homes. Two weeks later, I found the perfect place—and my offer was rejected in favor of a buyer who had &amp;ldquo;pre-approval.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s when I learned the hard lesson: &lt;strong&gt;pre-qualification and pre-approval are not the same thing&lt;/strong&gt;, and in competitive markets, only one of them actually matters to sellers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Much House Can You Really Afford? The 28/36 Rule Explained</title><link>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/how-much-house-can-you-really-afford-the-28/36-rule-explained/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/how-much-house-can-you-really-afford-the-28/36-rule-explained/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I got pre-approved for a mortgage, my lender told me I qualified for a $450,000 home.

&lt;p&gt;I was approved for way more house than I could comfortably afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;strong&gt;28/36 rule&lt;/strong&gt; comes in—a simple guideline that helps you figure out what you can actually afford based on your income and debts, not just what a lender will approve you for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
