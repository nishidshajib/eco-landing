Every single one gave me a different &amp;ldquo;rate&amp;rdquo;—ranging from 6.25% to 7.125%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was confused. Why would one lender offer me 6.25% while another quoted 7.125% for the exact same loan amount on the exact same day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that &amp;ldquo;the rate&amp;rdquo; you see advertised or quoted isn&amp;rsquo;t actually the full story. Understanding how mortgage rates really work—APR vs interest rate, points, credits, rate locks, and pricing adjustments—is the difference between overpaying and getting the best deal possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Shopping Multiple Lenders Saved Me $47,000—Here's How to Do It Right</title><link>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/shopping-multiple-lenders-saved-me-47000heres-how-to-do-it-right/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purchaseloanofficers.com/blogs/shopping-multiple-lenders-saved-me-47000heres-how-to-do-it-right/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I started shopping for a mortgage, I made the mistake most first-time buyers make: I went with the first lender who pre-approved me without comparing other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, a coworker casually mentioned he got a 6.25% rate with $1,800 in lender fees on a similar loan. My rate? 6.875% with $4,200 in lender fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the math and nearly threw up. My &amp;ldquo;convenient&amp;rdquo; decision to go with my bank without shopping around was going to cost me &lt;strong&gt;$47,000 over the life of the loan&lt;/strong&gt;—$230 per month in unnecessary interest and fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
