&lt;p&gt;Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, a coworker casually mentioned he got a 6.25% rate with $1,800 in lender fees on a similar loan. My rate? 6.875% with $4,200 in lender fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the math and nearly threw up. My &amp;ldquo;convenient&amp;rdquo; decision to go with my bank without shopping around was going to cost me &lt;strong&gt;$47,000 over the life of the loan&lt;/strong&gt;—$230 per month in unnecessary interest and fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
