The headline noise, conflicting advice from friends, and lender portal notifications created paralysis. So we treated the lock as a fire drill: three short sprints, repeatable documentation, and clear rules about who could approve changes. By Monday morning we submitted conditions, negotiated a float-down clause, and still had energy left to eat dinner like normal people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Lender Fit Scorecard That Saved Our Sanity</title><link>https://conventionalmortgagerates.com/blogs/the-lender-fit-scorecard-that-saved-our-sanity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalmortgagerates.com/blogs/the-lender-fit-scorecard-that-saved-our-sanity/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a lender for a conventional loan can feel like speed dating with spreadsheets. Everyone says they have the best rates, the friendliest processors, and the fastest turn times. We needed a way to cut through the charm and surface the facts, so we built a lender fit scorecard. The scorecard balances quantitative metrics with soft-skill signals and has become the backbone of every referral meeting we host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="build-the-categories-before-filling-in-names"&gt;Build the categories before filling in names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mistake we made was letting lenders define the agenda. Now we list the categories before the first call: pricing transparency, communication cadence, underwriting philosophy, appraisal management, and closing flexibility. Under pricing transparency we track whether the lender includes all loan-level price adjustments up front or waits until disclosures. For underwriting philosophy we note how comfortable they are handling compensating factors if appraisals come in light.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
