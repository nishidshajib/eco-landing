The huddle happens Sunday evening, lasts 40 minutes, and feeds every decision we make the following week. It has become the calmest part of the mortgage journey because it replaces speculation with receipts and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gather-inputs-before-anyone-joins"&gt;Gather inputs before anyone joins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours before the huddle, we drop three items into a shared folder: a digest of headlines with links to primary sources, a spreadsheet of lender pricing pulled from our shortlist, and a clip of the most relevant economic calendar events. For overlays and pricing quirks, we paste annotated screenshots from &lt;a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank"&gt;BrowseLenders.com&lt;/a&gt; so participants see exactly where the adjustments are hiding. Preparation is non-negotiable; the meeting is for decisions, not reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
