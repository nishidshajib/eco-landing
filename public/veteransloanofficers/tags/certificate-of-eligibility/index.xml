Entitlement is not a dollar cap on your loan; rather, it&amp;rsquo;s the VA&amp;rsquo;s guarantee to lenders that a portion of the loan will be repaid if you default. That guarantee gives lenders confidence to offer 0% down purchase options and favorable terms to eligible veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding your entitlement determines how much you can borrow, whether you need a down payment, and if you can use your VA benefit more than once. Many veterans don&amp;rsquo;t realize their entitlement is reusable or that they can have multiple VA loans simultaneously under the right circumstances. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about VA entitlement in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
