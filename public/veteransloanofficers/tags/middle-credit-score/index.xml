However, &lt;strong&gt;lenders&lt;/strong&gt; impose their own credit score minimums, called overlays, and these vary dramatically. Some VA specialists approve 580 scores while major banks require 640 or higher, meaning your lender choice directly affects whether you qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding which lenders approve your credit profile—and how to strengthen your application if you&amp;rsquo;re borderline—can mean the difference between approval and denial, or between a competitive rate and an expensive one. This guide breaks down VA loan credit score requirements by lender type, explains how manual underwriting works for veterans with middle credit scores, and shows you which compensating factors can overcome lower scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
