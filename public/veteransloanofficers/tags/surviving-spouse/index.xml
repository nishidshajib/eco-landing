For a $400,000 purchase with zero down, that&amp;rsquo;s $5,600 to $14,400—a substantial upfront cost that gets rolled into your loan balance and increases your monthly payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 10% or higher are &lt;strong&gt;completely exempt&lt;/strong&gt; from the VA funding fee. Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected conditions are also exempt. These exemptions can save thousands of dollars, yet many eligible veterans miss out because they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to claim the exemption or fail to provide the correct documentation to lenders.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
