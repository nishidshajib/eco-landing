However, &lt;strong&gt;lenders&lt;/strong&gt; impose their own credit score minimums, called overlays, and these vary dramatically. Some VA specialists approve 580 scores while major banks require 640 or higher, meaning your lender choice directly affects whether you qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding which lenders approve your credit profile—and how to strengthen your application if you&amp;rsquo;re borderline—can mean the difference between approval and denial, or between a competitive rate and an expensive one. This guide breaks down VA loan credit score requirements by lender type, explains how manual underwriting works for veterans with middle credit scores, and shows you which compensating factors can overcome lower scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VA Loan Entitlement Explained: How Much You Can Borrow and Why It Matters</title><link>https://www.veteransloanofficers.com/blogs/va-loan-entitlement-explained-how-much-you-can-borrow-and-why-it-matters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.veteransloanofficers.com/blogs/va-loan-entitlement-explained-how-much-you-can-borrow-and-why-it-matters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;VA loan entitlement confuses many veterans, but it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most important concepts in VA lending. Entitlement is not a dollar cap on your loan; rather, it&amp;rsquo;s the VA&amp;rsquo;s guarantee to lenders that a portion of the loan will be repaid if you default. That guarantee gives lenders confidence to offer 0% down purchase options and favorable terms to eligible veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding your entitlement determines how much you can borrow, whether you need a down payment, and if you can use your VA benefit more than once. Many veterans don&amp;rsquo;t realize their entitlement is reusable or that they can have multiple VA loans simultaneously under the right circumstances. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about VA entitlement in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
