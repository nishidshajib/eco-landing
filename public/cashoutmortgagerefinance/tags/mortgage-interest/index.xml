While mortgage interest deductions remain available, rules governing deductibility changed significantly with recent tax law modifications, making it essential to understand current regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="current-mortgage-interest-deduction-rules"&gt;Current Mortgage Interest Deduction Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly altered mortgage interest deduction rules. For loans originated after December 15, 2017, you can deduct interest on mortgage debt up to $750,000 if married filing jointly, or $375,000 if single or married filing separately. This applies to your combined first and second mortgage balances.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
