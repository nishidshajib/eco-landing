&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: FHA 203(k) renovation loan&lt;/strong&gt; – 3.5% down, flexible credit, government-backed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Fannie Mae HomeStyle® renovation loan&lt;/strong&gt; – 5-20% down, slightly stricter credit, conventional loan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the &lt;strong&gt;FHA 203(k)&lt;/strong&gt; because of the lower down payment (3.5% vs. 10-20%). We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a huge down payment saved, so 203(k) seemed like the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
