&lt;p&gt;The house needed &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;: new kitchen, both bathrooms gutted, flooring throughout, updated electrical, new HVAC, and cosmetic work in every room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t have $100,000 sitting around for renovations. Traditional financing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work—no bank will give you a mortgage on a house with a non-functioning kitchen and electrical code violations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
