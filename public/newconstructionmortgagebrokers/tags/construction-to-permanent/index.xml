But this automatic conversion only happens when specific conditions are met, timing is critical, and understanding how the conversion process works prevents surprises that could delay your move-in or increase your costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re financing new construction, understanding permanent conversion timing helps you coordinate with your builder, protect your rate lock, and ensure the transition from interest-only construction payments to principal-and-interest permanent payments happens smoothly when your home is ready for occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Construction-to-Permanent Loan Guide: Complete Process from Groundbreaking to Permanent Mortgage</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/construction-to-permanent-loan-guide-complete-process-from-groundbreaking-to-permanent-mortgage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/construction-to-permanent-loan-guide-complete-process-from-groundbreaking-to-permanent-mortgage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building your dream home from the ground up is exciting—but the financing can feel overwhelming if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand how construction-to-permanent loans actually work. Unlike traditional mortgages where you borrow once and start making payments immediately, construction-to-permanent financing structures everything differently: one closing, extended rate locks, draw-based funding, interest-only payments during the build, and automatic conversion to a traditional mortgage when construction is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re considering new construction, understanding this loan type is essential before signing builder contracts or breaking ground. Here&amp;rsquo;s everything you need to know about construction-to-permanent loans—from qualification through final conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
