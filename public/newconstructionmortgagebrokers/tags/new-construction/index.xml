But there&amp;rsquo;s another path to new construction ownership that&amp;rsquo;s faster, often less expensive, and requires simpler financing: buying a spec home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spec homes (short for &amp;ldquo;speculative&amp;rdquo; homes) are builder-constructed houses built without a specific buyer in mind—usually move-in ready or near completion when you start shopping.

Unlike traditional mortgages where you borrow once and start making payments immediately, construction-to-permanent financing structures everything differently: one closing, extended rate locks, draw-based funding, interest-only payments during the build, and automatic conversion to a traditional mortgage when construction is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re considering new construction, understanding this loan type is essential before signing builder contracts or breaking ground. Here&amp;rsquo;s everything you need to know about construction-to-permanent loans—from qualification through final conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
