Unlike buying an existing home where you close and move in within weeks, custom builds span months or even years—requiring you to coordinate builders, subcontractors, inspectors, lenders, and dozens of moving parts while managing a construction loan with draw schedules, interest-only payments, and rate lock expirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor timeline management can derail your construction financing: missed draw deadlines create builder cash flow problems, construction delays push your completion beyond rate lock expiration (forcing expensive extensions or relocks at higher rates), and budget overruns consume contingency funds that were meant to cover unexpected issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
