But this automatic conversion only happens when specific conditions are met, timing is critical, and understanding how the conversion process works prevents surprises that could delay your move-in or increase your costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re financing new construction, understanding permanent conversion timing helps you coordinate with your builder, protect your rate lock, and ensure the transition from interest-only construction payments to principal-and-interest permanent payments happens smoothly when your home is ready for occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Builder Reputation Verification Checklist: How to Verify Builder Credentials and Track Record</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/builder-reputation-verification-checklist-how-to-verify-builder-credentials-and-track-record/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/builder-reputation-verification-checklist-how-to-verify-builder-credentials-and-track-record/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right builder is the most important decision you&amp;rsquo;ll make in your construction journey—more important than floor plans, finishes, or even financing. A great builder delivers quality work on time and on budget, communicating proactively and standing behind their work long after you move in. A bad builder creates financial nightmares, timeline disasters, quality failures, and legal battles that can destroy your dream of homeownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet most people spend more time researching kitchen appliances than they do verifying their builder&amp;rsquo;s credentials, track record, and financial stability. They trust charming sales presentations, impressive model homes, or low initial bids without doing basic due diligence—discovering too late that their builder lacks proper licensing, carries insufficient insurance, or has a history of abandoned projects and unhappy clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Construction Draw Schedule Explained: Understanding the Construction Loan Draw Process</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/construction-draw-schedule-explained-understanding-the-construction-loan-draw-process/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/construction-draw-schedule-explained-understanding-the-construction-loan-draw-process/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never financed construction before, one of the most confusing aspects of construction loans is the draw schedule—how lenders release money in stages rather than all at once, why you only pay interest on drawn funds during construction, and what happens if your builder needs more money than the approved draw amount for a particular stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding construction draw schedules is essential before signing builder contracts or finalizing construction financing. The draw process affects your builder&amp;rsquo;s cash flow, determines when you start making loan payments, and creates checkpoints where lender inspections verify your project is progressing as planned.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Custom Build Timeline Management: Managing Construction Loan Timelines and Draw Schedules</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/custom-build-timeline-management-managing-construction-loan-timelines-and-draw-schedules/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/custom-build-timeline-management-managing-construction-loan-timelines-and-draw-schedules/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building a custom home is one of the most complex financial and logistical projects most people will ever undertake. Unlike buying an existing home where you close and move in within weeks, custom builds span months or even years—requiring you to coordinate builders, subcontractors, inspectors, lenders, and dozens of moving parts while managing a construction loan with draw schedules, interest-only payments, and rate lock expirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor timeline management can derail your construction financing: missed draw deadlines create builder cash flow problems, construction delays push your completion beyond rate lock expiration (forcing expensive extensions or relocks at higher rates), and budget overruns consume contingency funds that were meant to cover unexpected issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spec Home Purchase Strategy: Buying Spec Homes vs Custom Builds with Construction Financing</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/spec-home-purchase-strategy-buying-spec-homes-vs-custom-builds-with-construction-financing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/spec-home-purchase-strategy-buying-spec-homes-vs-custom-builds-with-construction-financing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When most people think about buying new construction, they imagine designing every detail from the ground up—choosing floor plans, selecting finishes, and watching their dream home come to life over months of construction. But there&amp;rsquo;s another path to new construction ownership that&amp;rsquo;s faster, often less expensive, and requires simpler financing: buying a spec home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spec homes (short for &amp;ldquo;speculative&amp;rdquo; homes) are builder-constructed houses built without a specific buyer in mind—usually move-in ready or near completion when you start shopping. Understanding the differences between spec home purchases and custom builds helps you choose the right new construction approach based on your timeline, budget, customization priorities, and financing situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Builder Financing Requirements: What Lenders Look for in Builder Credentials</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/builder-financing-requirements-what-lenders-look-for-in-builder-credentials/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/builder-financing-requirements-what-lenders-look-for-in-builder-credentials/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you apply for construction financing, your lender isn&amp;rsquo;t just evaluating you—they&amp;rsquo;re evaluating your builder. Construction loans carry significantly more risk than traditional mortgages because lenders are funding a home that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet, relying on your builder to complete the project on time, on budget, and to code. If your builder fails to deliver, the lender&amp;rsquo;s collateral (your partially completed home) could be worth far less than the loan amount.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Construction-to-Permanent Loan Guide: Complete Process from Groundbreaking to Permanent Mortgage</title><link>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/construction-to-permanent-loan-guide-complete-process-from-groundbreaking-to-permanent-mortgage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/construction-to-permanent-loan-guide-complete-process-from-groundbreaking-to-permanent-mortgage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building your dream home from the ground up is exciting—but the financing can feel overwhelming if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand how construction-to-permanent loans actually work. Unlike traditional mortgages where you borrow once and start making payments immediately, construction-to-permanent financing structures everything differently: one closing, extended rate locks, draw-based funding, interest-only payments during the build, and automatic conversion to a traditional mortgage when construction is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re considering new construction, understanding this loan type is essential before signing builder contracts or breaking ground. Here&amp;rsquo;s everything you need to know about construction-to-permanent loans—from qualification through final conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
