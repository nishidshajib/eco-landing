My home was worth $425,000, I owed $195,000, so I had $230,000 in equity—54% equity position. Cash-out refinance to 75% LTV would give me the cash I needed while maintaining healthy equity cushion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My loan officer ran initial rate quotes at my current 682 credit score: 7.25% for conventional cash-out refinance. My payment would increase from $1,340 to $1,965 per month on the new $318,750 loan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
