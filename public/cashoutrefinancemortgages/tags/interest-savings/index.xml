My home was worth $425,000, I owed $195,000, so I had $230,000 in equity—54% equity position. Cash-out refinance to 75% LTV would give me the cash I needed while maintaining healthy equity cushion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My loan officer ran initial rate quotes at my current 682 credit score: 7.25% for conventional cash-out refinance. My payment would increase from $1,340 to $1,965 per month on the new $318,750 loan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Paid Off $52,000 in Credit Card Debt Using Cash-Out Refinance—Here's the Exact Math on Why It Saved Me $37,400</title><link>https://cashoutrefinancemortgages.com/blogs/i-paid-off-52000-in-credit-card-debt-using-cash-out-refinanceheres-the-exact-math-on-why-it-saved-me-37400/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashoutrefinancemortgages.com/blogs/i-paid-off-52000-in-credit-card-debt-using-cash-out-refinanceheres-the-exact-math-on-why-it-saved-me-37400/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I sat at my kitchen table staring at credit card statements totaling $52,000 across six cards with interest rates ranging from 18.9% to 24.5%. My minimum payments were $1,640 per month, and I was barely making progress on principal—most of each payment went straight to interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home had appreciated significantly since purchase three years earlier. I owed $215,000 on a property now worth $380,000. That meant I had $165,000 in equity—43% equity position. A friend mentioned cash-out refinance as a debt consolidation strategy, so I started researching whether the math actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
