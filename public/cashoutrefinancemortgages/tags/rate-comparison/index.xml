But I had one critical factor that changed everything: &lt;strong&gt;a 3.25% interest rate on my existing mortgage from 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing my 3.25% rate with today&amp;rsquo;s 6.875% cash-out refinance rate would have cost me an extra $41,000 in interest over 7 years—even after factoring in the debt consolidation savings.

My home was worth $520,000, I owed $245,000, giving me $275,000 in equity—53% equity position. I had three main options for accessing that equity: cash-out refinance, HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit), or home equity loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most homeowners just go with whatever their bank offers first. I decided to analyze all three options comprehensively before making a decision—and the results surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
