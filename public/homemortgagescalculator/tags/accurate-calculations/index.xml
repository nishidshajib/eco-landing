Before making offers, I wanted to know my exact monthly payment to ensure it fit my budget comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did what any responsible buyer would do—I used online mortgage calculators to estimate my payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried three popular calculators, entering identical information each time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loan amount: $385,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down payment: $38,500 (10%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rate: 6.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loan term: 30 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected three identical results. After all, mortgage math is standardized—principal and interest calculations don&amp;rsquo;t vary between calculators.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
