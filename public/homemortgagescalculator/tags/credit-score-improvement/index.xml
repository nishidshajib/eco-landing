Pre-approved for $400K, found the perfect house listed at $385K, started imagining furniture placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I ran my mortgage payment through a credit impact calculator. My credit score was 677—just three points below the 680 threshold where rates improve significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculator showed me something that changed everything: At 677, my rate was 7.125%. At 680, it dropped to 6.875%. At 700, it would be 6.5%.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
