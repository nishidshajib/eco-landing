The top answer wasn’t retirement or student loans—it was figuring out how to qualify for a mortgage without getting ripped off. That insight led us to pilot a conforming loan education benefit. After six months, here’s what we learned, what employees loved, and how we measured success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-1-define-the-problem-accurately"&gt;Step 1: Define the problem accurately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees didn’t just want a “mortgage calculator.” They wanted unbiased guidance on conforming loan limits, debt-to-income ratios, middle credit scores, and when to refinance. We surveyed staff anonymously and discovered three themes:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
