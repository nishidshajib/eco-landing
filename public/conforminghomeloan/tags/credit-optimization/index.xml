I monitor my credit through two different consumer apps, and both said I was in the low 700s. What followed was an eight-week sprint to learn how middle credit scores really work, fix the items dragging mine down, and earn the rate I wanted on a conforming loan. This isn’t theory—it’s the exact roadmap I used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto-scores, VantageScores, and bank-provided updates are directional, not definitive. My loan officer suggested I pull a tri-merge report through a mortgage-preferred vendor so I could see every bureau line item the underwriter would analyze. The $60 fee hurt less than paying a higher rate for 30 years. Once the report arrived, I created a spreadsheet with three columns—Equifax, Experian, TransUnion—and highlighted the differences. Two medical collections showed on one bureau while the others marked them as paid. Utilization appeared at 54% on a travel card because the statement cut before my payment hit. With the real data in hand, I was able to set priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
