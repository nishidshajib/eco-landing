Conforming loans (backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) offer better rates and lower lifetime costs for borrowers with strong credit, while FHA loans (insured by the Federal Housing Administration) provide easier qualification for borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller down payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding which loan type fits your financial profile helps you save money, qualify faster, and avoid unnecessary costs over the life of your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conforming vs. Jumbo Loans in 2025: Loan Limits, Rates, and Qualification Strategies</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-jumbo-loans-in-2025-loan-limits-rates-and-qualification-strategies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-jumbo-loans-in-2025-loan-limits-rates-and-qualification-strategies/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between &lt;strong&gt;conforming loans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jumbo loans&lt;/strong&gt; comes down to loan limits—conforming loans stay within FHFA maximums ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas), while jumbo loans exceed these limits. This distinction affects everything: interest rates, qualification requirements, down payment expectations, and long-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For buyers in expensive markets or purchasing high-value properties, understanding the conforming vs jumbo boundary is essential for securing the best possible financing terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conforming vs. Non-Conforming: How 2025 Loan Limits Shape Your Conventional Mortgage Options</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-non-conforming-how-2025-loan-limits-shape-your-conventional-mortgage-options/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-non-conforming-how-2025-loan-limits-shape-your-conventional-mortgage-options/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The distinction between &lt;strong&gt;conforming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;non-conforming&lt;/strong&gt; loans is fundamental to understanding conventional mortgage financing. Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards—including staying within FHFA loan limits ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas)—which allows them to be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises. Non-conforming loans either exceed these limits or fail to meet underwriting standards, requiring portfolio lending with stricter requirements and typically higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether your loan is conforming or non-conforming affects everything: interest rates, down payment expectations, qualification requirements, and long-term affordability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Your Middle Credit Score Impacts Conforming Mortgage Rates in 2025</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/how-your-middle-credit-score-impacts-conforming-mortgage-rates-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/how-your-middle-credit-score-impacts-conforming-mortgage-rates-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you apply for a &lt;strong&gt;conforming mortgage&lt;/strong&gt;, lenders don&amp;rsquo;t use your highest credit score or your lowest—they use your &lt;strong&gt;middle credit score&lt;/strong&gt; (the median of your three FICO scores from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) to determine your interest rate. This single number affects your loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs), which directly translate to higher or lower monthly payments over 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how your middle credit score impacts conforming mortgage rates helps you set realistic expectations, identify opportunities to improve your score before applying, and potentially save tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
