Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards—including staying within FHFA loan limits ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas)—which allows them to be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises. Non-conforming loans either exceed these limits or fail to meet underwriting standards, requiring portfolio lending with stricter requirements and typically higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether your loan is conforming or non-conforming affects everything: interest rates, down payment expectations, qualification requirements, and long-term affordability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
