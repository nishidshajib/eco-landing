For 2025, the &lt;strong&gt;baseline conforming limit is $766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with &lt;strong&gt;high-cost areas reaching up to $1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. These limits directly impact how much you can borrow at conforming rates, what homes you can afford, and whether you&amp;rsquo;ll need jumbo financing to complete your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First-Time Buyers and Conventional Loans: Credit, Down Payments, and Rate Strategies for 2025</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/first-time-buyers-and-conventional-loans-credit-down-payments-and-rate-strategies-for-2025/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/first-time-buyers-and-conventional-loans-credit-down-payments-and-rate-strategies-for-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-time homebuyers&lt;/strong&gt; often assume they need FHA loans or 20% down payments to buy a home—but conventional loans offer some of the best financing options for first-time buyers in 2025, including &lt;strong&gt;3% down payment programs&lt;/strong&gt;, competitive rates for borrowers with 620+ credit scores, and access to conforming loan limits up to $766,550 (or $1,149,825 in high-cost areas).
