For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is &lt;strong&gt;$766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with high-cost areas reaching up to &lt;strong&gt;$1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding these limits by state and county is essential for determining whether you need conforming, high-balance conforming, or jumbo financing—and how your loan amount affects rate eligibility and approval odds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conforming vs. FHA Loans in 2025: Key Differences, Credit Requirements, and Loan Limits Explained</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-fha-loans-in-2025-key-differences-credit-requirements-and-loan-limits-explained/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-fha-loans-in-2025-key-differences-credit-requirements-and-loan-limits-explained/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When comparing &lt;strong&gt;conforming loans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;FHA loans&lt;/strong&gt; in 2025, the biggest differences come down to credit requirements, down payment flexibility, loan limits, and long-term costs. Conforming loans (backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) offer better rates and lower lifetime costs for borrowers with strong credit, while FHA loans (insured by the Federal Housing Administration) provide easier qualification for borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller down payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding which loan type fits your financial profile helps you save money, qualify faster, and avoid unnecessary costs over the life of your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conforming vs. Jumbo Loans in 2025: Loan Limits, Rates, and Qualification Strategies</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-jumbo-loans-in-2025-loan-limits-rates-and-qualification-strategies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-jumbo-loans-in-2025-loan-limits-rates-and-qualification-strategies/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between &lt;strong&gt;conforming loans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jumbo loans&lt;/strong&gt; comes down to loan limits—conforming loans stay within FHFA maximums ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas), while jumbo loans exceed these limits. This distinction affects everything: interest rates, qualification requirements, down payment expectations, and long-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For buyers in expensive markets or purchasing high-value properties, understanding the conforming vs jumbo boundary is essential for securing the best possible financing terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conforming vs. Non-Conforming: How 2025 Loan Limits Shape Your Conventional Mortgage Options</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-non-conforming-how-2025-loan-limits-shape-your-conventional-mortgage-options/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conforming-vs.-non-conforming-how-2025-loan-limits-shape-your-conventional-mortgage-options/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The distinction between &lt;strong&gt;conforming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;non-conforming&lt;/strong&gt; loans is fundamental to understanding conventional mortgage financing. Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards—including staying within FHFA loan limits ($766,550 baseline for 2025, up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas)—which allows them to be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises. Non-conforming loans either exceed these limits or fail to meet underwriting standards, requiring portfolio lending with stricter requirements and typically higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding whether your loan is conforming or non-conforming affects everything: interest rates, down payment expectations, qualification requirements, and long-term affordability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conventional Loan Limits 2025: How New Conforming Caps Shape Affordability and Opportunity</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-how-new-conforming-caps-shape-affordability-and-opportunity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/conventional-loan-limits-2025-how-new-conforming-caps-shape-affordability-and-opportunity/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 conventional loan limits—set annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)—determine the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the &lt;strong&gt;baseline conforming limit is $766,550&lt;/strong&gt; for single-family homes in most counties, with &lt;strong&gt;high-cost areas reaching up to $1,149,825&lt;/strong&gt;. These limits directly impact how much you can borrow at conforming rates, what homes you can afford, and whether you&amp;rsquo;ll need jumbo financing to complete your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Your Middle Credit Score Impacts Conforming Mortgage Rates in 2025</title><link>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/how-your-middle-credit-score-impacts-conforming-mortgage-rates-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conformingloanofficers.com/blogs/how-your-middle-credit-score-impacts-conforming-mortgage-rates-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you apply for a &lt;strong&gt;conforming mortgage&lt;/strong&gt;, lenders don&amp;rsquo;t use your highest credit score or your lowest—they use your &lt;strong&gt;middle credit score&lt;/strong&gt; (the median of your three FICO scores from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) to determine your interest rate. This single number affects your loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs), which directly translate to higher or lower monthly payments over 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how your middle credit score impacts conforming mortgage rates helps you set realistic expectations, identify opportunities to improve your score before applying, and potentially save tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
