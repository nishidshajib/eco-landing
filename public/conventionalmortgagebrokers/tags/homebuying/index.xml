&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-mortgage-broker"&gt;What Is a Mortgage Broker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mortgage broker is a licensed professional who acts as an intermediary between you and multiple lenders. Brokers don&amp;rsquo;t lend money themselves—they compare loan offers from their network of banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies to find your best match.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
