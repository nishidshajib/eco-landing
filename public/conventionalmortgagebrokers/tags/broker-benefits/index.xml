&lt;p&gt;Mortgage brokers access wholesale rate sheets from dozens of lenders simultaneously. Instead of applying to three banks individually (triggering multiple credit pulls), your broker submits one application and receives competing offers. This competition drives rates down—often by 0.125% to 0.375%, saving $15,000-$45,000 over a 30-year loan on a $400,000 mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
