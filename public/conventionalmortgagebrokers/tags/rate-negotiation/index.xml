Here are five insider tactics experienced brokers use to save you thousands on conventional loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tactic-1-volume-based-rate-discounts"&gt;Tactic 1: Volume-Based Rate Discounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers who close dozens of loans monthly with the same lenders earn preferred pricing tiers. Lenders offer rate discounts to high-volume brokers because they bring consistent business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard broker: 7.0% rate, 1.5% origination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-volume broker: 6.75% rate, 1.0% origination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your savings on $400,000 loan&lt;/strong&gt;: $12,000 over 5 years plus $2,000 lower closing costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Mortgage Brokers Save You Money: 5 Ways Brokers Cut Costs</title><link>https://conventionalmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-save-you-money-5-ways-brokers-cut-costs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 09:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://conventionalmortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-save-you-money-5-ways-brokers-cut-costs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Licensed mortgage brokers aren&amp;rsquo;t just intermediaries—they&amp;rsquo;re financial advocates who can save you thousands on your conventional mortgage. Here&amp;rsquo;s exactly how brokers deliver real cost savings that direct lenders simply can&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-multi-lender-rate-comparison"&gt;1. Multi-Lender Rate Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage brokers access wholesale rate sheets from dozens of lenders simultaneously. Instead of applying to three banks individually (triggering multiple credit pulls), your broker submits one application and receives competing offers. This competition drives rates down—often by 0.125% to 0.375%, saving $15,000-$45,000 over a 30-year loan on a $400,000 mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
