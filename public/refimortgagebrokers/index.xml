I thought brokers were supposed to save me money—did I get ripped off?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed her Closing Disclosure. The &amp;ldquo;$4,500 broker fee&amp;rdquo; was actually $1,200 to the broker plus $3,300 in title, appraisal, and other third-party costs that every refinance has regardless of who you use. The $3,200 &amp;ldquo;lender fees&amp;rdquo; were mostly prepaid taxes and insurance that go into escrow, not lender profit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wholesale vs Retail Mortgage Rates: Why Brokers Beat Banks on Refinancing Costs</title><link>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/wholesale-vs-retail-mortgage-rates-why-brokers-beat-banks-on-refinancing-costs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/wholesale-vs-retail-mortgage-rates-why-brokers-beat-banks-on-refinancing-costs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="wholesale-vs-retail-mortgage-rates-the-pricing-gap-costing-you-thousands"&gt;Wholesale vs. Retail Mortgage Rates: The Pricing Gap Costing You Thousands&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your bank will refinance your mortgage at 6.25%. A mortgage broker can get you 5.875% from the same bank&amp;rsquo;s wholesale division. Same lender, same borrower, same property—but a 0.375% rate difference worth $68 per month or $24,480 over the life of a $300,000 loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wholesale versus retail pricing gap exists in almost every refinance scenario and is the primary reason brokers consistently beat banks on total refinance costs. Yet most homeowners have no idea this two-tier pricing structure even exists—much less how to access the better wholesale rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mortgage Broker Rate Lock Strategies for Refinancing in 2025</title><link>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/mortgage-broker-rate-lock-strategies-for-refinancing-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/mortgage-broker-rate-lock-strategies-for-refinancing-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a homeowner lock his refinance rate at 6.25% on Monday. By Friday, rates had dropped to 5.875%. He was stuck with the higher rate and lost $63 per month ($22,680 over the loan life) because he locked too early without understanding market timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another borrower floated her rate for two weeks waiting for a better entry point. Rates jumped 0.5% during that time. She ended up locking at 6.75% when she could have had 6.25%—costing her $91 monthly ($32,760 over life).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Refinance Rate Shopping Guide 2025: Comparing Brokers vs Banks vs Credit Unions</title><link>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/refinance-rate-shopping-guide-2025-comparing-brokers-vs-banks-vs-credit-unions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/refinance-rate-shopping-guide-2025-comparing-brokers-vs-banks-vs-credit-unions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ask ten homeowners where they refinanced and you will get ten different answers: their current bank, a big national lender, a local credit union, an online broker, their neighbor&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. But here&amp;rsquo;s what almost none of them did: systematically compare rates across ALL these lender types to find which actually delivered the lowest total cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people refinance with whoever makes the process easiest, assuming rates are &amp;ldquo;pretty similar&amp;rdquo; across lenders. That assumption costs tens of thousands of dollars because refinance rates can vary by 0.25-0.75% between lender types—and even more within each category based on your specific credit, property, and loan characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Mortgage Brokers Find Better Refinance Rates Than Banks in 2025</title><link>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-find-better-refinance-rates-than-banks-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-find-better-refinance-rates-than-banks-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what most homeowners refinancing their mortgage don&amp;rsquo;t realize: the bank offering you 6.5% would give a mortgage broker 6.125% on the exact same loan. That 0.375% difference costs you over $20,000 on a $300,000 refinance over 30 years—money that stays in your pocket when you use a broker instead of going direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this pricing gap is simple: brokers access wholesale lender channels that offer better rates than retail bank divisions. Let me show you exactly how this works and why refinancing through a broker beats going direct to your bank in almost every scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
