But here&amp;rsquo;s what almost none of them did: systematically compare rates across ALL these lender types to find which actually delivered the lowest total cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people refinance with whoever makes the process easiest, assuming rates are &amp;ldquo;pretty similar&amp;rdquo; across lenders. That assumption costs tens of thousands of dollars because refinance rates can vary by 0.25-0.75% between lender types—and even more within each category based on your specific credit, property, and loan characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Mortgage Brokers Find Better Refinance Rates Than Banks in 2025</title><link>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-find-better-refinance-rates-than-banks-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-find-better-refinance-rates-than-banks-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what most homeowners refinancing their mortgage don&amp;rsquo;t realize: the bank offering you 6.5% would give a mortgage broker 6.125% on the exact same loan. That 0.375% difference costs you over $20,000 on a $300,000 refinance over 30 years—money that stays in your pocket when you use a broker instead of going direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this pricing gap is simple: brokers access wholesale lender channels that offer better rates than retail bank divisions. Let me show you exactly how this works and why refinancing through a broker beats going direct to your bank in almost every scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
