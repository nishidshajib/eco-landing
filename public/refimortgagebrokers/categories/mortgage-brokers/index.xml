&lt;p&gt;Your bank will refinance your mortgage at 6.25%. A mortgage broker can get you 5.875% from the same bank&amp;rsquo;s wholesale division. Same lender, same borrower, same property—but a 0.375% rate difference worth $68 per month or $24,480 over the life of a $300,000 loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wholesale versus retail pricing gap exists in almost every refinance scenario and is the primary reason brokers consistently beat banks on total refinance costs. Yet most homeowners have no idea this two-tier pricing structure even exists—much less how to access the better wholesale rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Mortgage Brokers Find Better Refinance Rates Than Banks in 2025</title><link>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-find-better-refinance-rates-than-banks-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.refimortgagebrokers.com/blogs/how-mortgage-brokers-find-better-refinance-rates-than-banks-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what most homeowners refinancing their mortgage don&amp;rsquo;t realize: the bank offering you 6.5% would give a mortgage broker 6.125% on the exact same loan. That 0.375% difference costs you over $20,000 on a $300,000 refinance over 30 years—money that stays in your pocket when you use a broker instead of going direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this pricing gap is simple: brokers access wholesale lender channels that offer better rates than retail bank divisions. Let me show you exactly how this works and why refinancing through a broker beats going direct to your bank in almost every scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
