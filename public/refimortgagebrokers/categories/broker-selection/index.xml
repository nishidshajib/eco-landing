I thought brokers were supposed to save me money—did I get ripped off?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed her Closing Disclosure. The &amp;ldquo;$4,500 broker fee&amp;rdquo; was actually $1,200 to the broker plus $3,300 in title, appraisal, and other third-party costs that every refinance has regardless of who you use. The $3,200 &amp;ldquo;lender fees&amp;rdquo; were mostly prepaid taxes and insurance that go into escrow, not lender profit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
