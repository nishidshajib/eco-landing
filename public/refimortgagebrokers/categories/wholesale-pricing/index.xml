&lt;p&gt;Your bank will refinance your mortgage at 6.25%. A mortgage broker can get you 5.875% from the same bank&amp;rsquo;s wholesale division. Same lender, same borrower, same property—but a 0.375% rate difference worth $68 per month or $24,480 over the life of a $300,000 loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wholesale versus retail pricing gap exists in almost every refinance scenario and is the primary reason brokers consistently beat banks on total refinance costs. Yet most homeowners have no idea this two-tier pricing structure even exists—much less how to access the better wholesale rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
