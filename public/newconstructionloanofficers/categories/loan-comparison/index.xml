&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Time Close)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a construction loan that automatically converts to a permanent mortgage when the home is finished. You close once, get one set of closing costs, and you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Two Closings)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a short-term construction loan to fund the build, then refinance into a permanent mortgage when construction is complete. You close twice, pay two sets of closing costs, and deal with two separate loans.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
