&lt;p&gt;I spent weeks researching construction loans, getting confused by terms like &amp;ldquo;construction-to-permanent,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;one-time close,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;draw schedules,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;interest-only payments.&amp;rdquo; By the time I figured it out, we were already under contract with a builder and scrambling to find the right financing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Builder Incentives vs. Independent Lenders: I Chose Wrong and It Cost Me $12,000</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/builder-incentives-vs.-independent-lenders-i-chose-wrong-and-it-cost-me-12000/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/builder-incentives-vs.-independent-lenders-i-chose-wrong-and-it-cost-me-12000/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I bought my new construction home two years ago, the builder&amp;rsquo;s sales rep made me an offer I thought I couldn&amp;rsquo;t refuse: &lt;strong&gt;$15,000 in closing cost assistance and $5,000 in design center upgrades&lt;/strong&gt; if I financed through their preferred lender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the math in my head: &amp;ldquo;$20,000 in free money? I&amp;rsquo;d be crazy to say no!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I signed up with the builder&amp;rsquo;s preferred lender without shopping around. Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>New Home Warranties: What's Actually Covered (And What Cost Me $8,400 to Learn)</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/new-home-warranties-whats-actually-covered-and-what-cost-me-8400-to-learn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/new-home-warranties-whats-actually-covered-and-what-cost-me-8400-to-learn/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Three months after moving into my beautiful new construction home, I noticed a dark stain spreading across my dining room ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called my builder immediately, confident my warranty would cover it. The sales rep had told me, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything&amp;rsquo;s covered for at least a year—you&amp;rsquo;re fully protected!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The builder sent an inspector. His conclusion: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roof installation looks fine. This is likely condensation from your HVAC system. Not covered under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My 7-Month Build Took 11 Months: How to Survive Construction Delays (And What They Cost)</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/my-7-month-build-took-11-months-how-to-survive-construction-delays-and-what-they-cost/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/my-7-month-build-took-11-months-how-to-survive-construction-delays-and-what-they-cost/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I signed our builder contract in January 2023, the sales rep promised a &lt;strong&gt;7-month completion timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll be moving in by August, just in time for back-to-school!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave notice to our landlord, planned our move, and locked our interest rate for 9 months (with a 2-month buffer &amp;ldquo;just to be safe&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August came and went.&lt;/strong&gt; No house.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;September came and went.&lt;/strong&gt; Still no house.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;October came and went.&lt;/strong&gt; Foundation was poured, but framing hadn&amp;rsquo;t started.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spec Home vs. Custom Build: Why I'd Choose Differently Next Time</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/spec-home-vs.-custom-build-why-id-choose-differently-next-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/spec-home-vs.-custom-build-why-id-choose-differently-next-time/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I spent months debating: &lt;strong&gt;Should we buy a spec home or custom build?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spec home:&lt;/strong&gt; Move-in ready (or nearly ready), fixed price, traditional financing, close in 30-60 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom build:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose everything (floor plan, finishes, lot), construction loan complexity, 7-12 month timeline (or longer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to &lt;strong&gt;custom build&lt;/strong&gt;. We wanted the perfect home, exactly as we envisioned it, with every detail our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back 18 months later, after going through construction delays, cost overruns, financing complications, and endless decision fatigue—&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d choose a spec home&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rate Lock Strategies for Construction: How I Locked at 6.75% and Saved $28,000</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/rate-lock-strategies-for-construction-how-i-locked-at-6.75-and-saved-28000/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/rate-lock-strategies-for-construction-how-i-locked-at-6.75-and-saved-28000/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I signed my builder contract in March 2023, interest rates were sitting at &lt;strong&gt;6.75%&lt;/strong&gt; for construction-to-permanent loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lender offered me two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Lock your rate today at 6.75%&lt;/strong&gt; for 12 months (with a float-down option if rates drop)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Float your rate&lt;/strong&gt; and lock later when your home is closer to completion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a decision to make: &lt;strong&gt;Lock now and hope rates don&amp;rsquo;t drop?&lt;/strong&gt; Or &lt;strong&gt;float and risk rates going up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One-Time Close vs. Two Closings: Why I Paid $7,200 Less with Construction-to-Permanent</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/one-time-close-vs.-two-closings-why-i-paid-7200-less-with-construction-to-permanent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/one-time-close-vs.-two-closings-why-i-paid-7200-less-with-construction-to-permanent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I started researching construction financing for my new build, I quickly learned there are &lt;strong&gt;two main options&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Time Close)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a construction loan that automatically converts to a permanent mortgage when the home is finished. You close once, get one set of closing costs, and you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Two Closings)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a short-term construction loan to fund the build, then refinance into a permanent mortgage when construction is complete. You close twice, pay two sets of closing costs, and deal with two separate loans.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5 Construction Loan Mistakes That Nearly Cost Me My Dream Home</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/5-construction-loan-mistakes-that-nearly-cost-me-my-dream-home/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/5-construction-loan-mistakes-that-nearly-cost-me-my-dream-home/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building my dream home was supposed to be exciting—and it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was also &lt;strong&gt;terrifying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five times during the process, I made mistakes that nearly derailed the entire project. I&amp;rsquo;m talking &lt;strong&gt;close calls&lt;/strong&gt; that could have cost me tens of thousands of dollars, delayed my closing, or even forced me to walk away from the build entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got lucky. I caught these mistakes (or someone else caught them for me) before they became disasters. But looking back, I realize how easily things could have gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
