&lt;p&gt;I did the math in my head: &amp;ldquo;$20,000 in free money? I&amp;rsquo;d be crazy to say no!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was also &lt;strong&gt;terrifying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five times during the process, I made mistakes that nearly derailed the entire project. I&amp;rsquo;m talking &lt;strong&gt;close calls&lt;/strong&gt; that could have cost me tens of thousands of dollars, delayed my closing, or even forced me to walk away from the build entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got lucky. I caught these mistakes (or someone else caught them for me) before they became disasters. But looking back, I realize how easily things could have gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
