&lt;p&gt;Water damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called my builder immediately, confident my warranty would cover it. The sales rep had told me, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything&amp;rsquo;s covered for at least a year—you&amp;rsquo;re fully protected!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The builder sent an inspector. His conclusion: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roof installation looks fine. This is likely condensation from your HVAC system. Not covered under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
