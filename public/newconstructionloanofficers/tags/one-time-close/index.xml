&lt;p&gt;I spent weeks researching construction loans, getting confused by terms like &amp;ldquo;construction-to-permanent,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;one-time close,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;draw schedules,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;interest-only payments.&amp;rdquo; By the time I figured it out, we were already under contract with a builder and scrambling to find the right financing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One-Time Close vs. Two Closings: Why I Paid $7,200 Less with Construction-to-Permanent</title><link>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/one-time-close-vs.-two-closings-why-i-paid-7200-less-with-construction-to-permanent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://newconstructionloanofficers.com/blogs/one-time-close-vs.-two-closings-why-i-paid-7200-less-with-construction-to-permanent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I started researching construction financing for my new build, I quickly learned there are &lt;strong&gt;two main options&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Time Close)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a construction loan that automatically converts to a permanent mortgage when the home is finished. You close once, get one set of closing costs, and you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Two Closings)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a short-term construction loan to fund the build, then refinance into a permanent mortgage when construction is complete. You close twice, pay two sets of closing costs, and deal with two separate loans.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
