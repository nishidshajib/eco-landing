      <title>A Transparency Tour For Expanded-Criteria Lenders</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expanded-criteria lending thrives on clarity. Every stakeholder—borrower, lender, CPA, relocation team—needs to know exactly what is happening, why it matters, and what happens next. We call our process the “transparency tour” because it feels like walking someone through a museum exhibit: each stop has a story, a supporting artifact, and a clear takeaway. When everyone takes the same tour, the odds of a last-minute surprise drop dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;stop-1-intent--context&#34;&gt;Stop 1: Intent + context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We open with a short intent memo. It outlines loan amount, property use, target close, compensation style, liquidity sources, and unique considerations like RSU cliffs or global income. The memo lives inside the same portal where we archive lender receipts, so anyone joining midstream can get oriented in minutes. This single document saves hours of repetition because we no longer re-explain the borrower’s story every time a new underwriter or executive enters the chat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inside Our Non-QM Term Sheet Lab</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/nonconformingmortgagerates/blogs/non-qm-term-sheet-lab/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our “term sheet lab” started as a Google Doc. We needed a place to compare DSCR, bank statement, and 1099 programs without losing track of who said what. Over time the doc evolved into a structured workflow with live calculators, escalation notes, and stakeholder-ready narratives. The format matters less than the discipline; when everyone reads from the same playbook, approvals arrive faster and negotiations feel calmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;gather-the-raw-ingredients&#34;&gt;Gather the raw ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lab opens with raw data: lender name, contact, timestamp, and documentation type. We stack the quotes vertically instead of side-by-side because it forces us to read each assumption slowly. Loan amount, amortization schedule, interest-only periods, prepay language, and reserve expectations appear under each lender’s header. By the time we finish typing, we already understand which quote deserves deeper analysis and which one misread the file from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How We Audit Every Jumbo Rate Quote</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1379/nonconformingmortgagerates/blogs/jumbo-rate-audit-playbook/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The phrase “jumbo rate quote” sounds definitive until you compare three lenders and realize each one defines the rules differently. That is why our team treats every quote like an artifact that must be documented, challenged, and indexed for future reference. We are not trying to be difficult; we just know expanded-criteria loans come with more moving parts, more overlays, and more opportunities for mistakes. An audit-friendly process protects borrowers and helps lenders move faster because the facts are organized from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
