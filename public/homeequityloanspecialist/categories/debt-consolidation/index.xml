Our family built a Sunday evening standup to keep progress visible and reduce the chance that the new credit line simply becomes a more expensive credit card. The ritual takes 30 minutes, involves whoever is attached to the debts, and relies on a living spreadsheet that we update together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-1-pair-intentions-with-hard-numbers"&gt;Step 1: Pair intentions with hard numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start every standup by opening the payoff tracker that lives next to our interest-rate comparisons from &lt;a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank"&gt;Cash-OutRefinance.com&lt;/a&gt;. The tracker lists every balance we rolled into the HELOC, the original APR, and the promised payoff date. Seeing the math this way keeps emotions in check. If someone is tempted to swipe a card for a nonessential purchase, they can immediately see how much longer we would carry that balance. We log any new spending ideas in a &amp;ldquo;parking lot&amp;rdquo; column so the thought is captured without derailing the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
