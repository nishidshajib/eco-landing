By the second draw, curiosity won. I asked if I could quietly tag along, and he laughed: “Please do—borrowers who show up make my paperwork easier.” Riding along became one of the smartest decisions I made. It turned draw days from mystery events into collaborative checkpoints that impressed my lender, inspired my contractor, and kept change orders grounded in reality. Here is what those visits taught me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I Paired Credit Moves With Every FHA 203(k) Draw</title><link>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/how-i-paired-credit-moves-with-every-fha-203k-draw/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 09:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/how-i-paired-credit-moves-with-every-fha-203k-draw/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My FHA 203(k) file almost derailed before demo day because I underestimated how every trip to the hardware store would show up on my credit reports. I had the cash to cover purchases, but lenders only see balances—if utilization spikes between draws, approvals wobble. I avoided disaster by aligning each credit move with the draw schedule, then documenting it inside MiddleCreditScore.com so the lender could see my logic. Here is the playbook that kept my middle score steady while the rehab charged forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The 48-Hour Contractor Interview Sprint That Saved My FHA 203(k) Timeline</title><link>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/the-48-hour-contractor-interview-sprint-that-saved-my-fha-203k-timeline/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/the-48-hour-contractor-interview-sprint-that-saved-my-fha-203k-timeline/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I assumed lining up contractors for my FHA 203(k) was the easy part—send a scope, collect a few bids, pick the friendliest voice. Then my HUD consultant reminded me that every subcontractor would be vetted by the lender, that every change would ripple through the draw schedule, and that the clock on my purchase contract did not care about anyone’s backlog. Instead of stretching the interviews across weeks, I ran an intentional 48-hour sprint. By Monday morning, I had three rehab-ready bids, a synced timeline, and a lender who called the prep “shockingly organized.” Here is the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building the Rehab Appraisal Brief That Won Over My Lender</title><link>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/building-the-rehab-appraisal-brief-that-won-over-my-lender/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 07:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/building-the-rehab-appraisal-brief-that-won-over-my-lender/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When the underwriter asked for “more comfort” around my after-improved value (ARV), I realized my file still looked like a pile of emails instead of a story. I spent one long Sunday building what I now call the Rehab Appraisal Brief—a single PDF that combined comps, scope clarification, contractor proof, and credit-ready milestones. By Monday afternoon the lender cleared the valuation condition without asking another question. Here is the step-by-step walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>We Turned HUD Consultant Check-Ins into Weekly Office Hours</title><link>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/we-turned-hud-consultant-check-ins-into-weekly-office-hours/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 09:10:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/we-turned-hud-consultant-check-ins-into-weekly-office-hours/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My FHA 203(k) felt chaotic until we turned random phone calls into structured “office hours” with the HUD consultant. Every Thursday at 4:00 p.m. we hop on a 30-minute video call, camera on, scopes open. It sounds small, but since launching the ritual we have had zero surprise inspection fails, zero missing invoices, and just one change-order dispute (which we resolved live). If you’re about to start a rehab, here’s a blueprint you can copy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My 30-Day Punch-List Week Checklist</title><link>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/my-30-day-punch-list-week-checklist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 06:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://fha203kmortgages.com/blogs/my-30-day-punch-list-week-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The most stressful part of my FHA 203(k) rehab wasn’t demolition or framing—it was the final 30 days, when every punch-list item mattered and the final draw dangled over our heads. I wrote a “Punch-List Week Checklist” to keep myself sane. Instead of guessing what to do each day, I followed this cadence and shared it with my contractor, HUD consultant, and loan officer. We hit every inspection on plan, kept the budget balanced, and unlocked the last disbursement without scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
