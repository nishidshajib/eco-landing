My loan officer quoted me 7.25% for $85,000 cash-out at 80% LTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he showed me something that changed everything: &lt;strong&gt;If I improved my credit to 720+, my rate would drop to 6.625%—a 0.625% difference saving $113/month or $16,900 over 5 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 5 months strategically improving my credit from 678 to 724. When I refinanced, I got 6.625% instead of 7.25%. That 5-month delay to improve credit saved me $16,900 in interest costs—absolutely worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
