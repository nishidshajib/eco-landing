Should I cash-out refinance now at $445,000 value with a 6.75% rate, or wait 12 months for more appreciation to $462,800 but risk rising rates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious. &lt;strong&gt;Waiting meant $11,910 more equity access but potentially 0.50% higher rates costing $198/month more on a larger loan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a complete timing analysis model comparing immediate refinancing versus waiting for more appreciation while accounting for rate environment changes, opportunity cost of delayed access to cash-out funds, appreciation projection confidence, and breakeven calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
