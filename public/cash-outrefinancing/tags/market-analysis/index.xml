People thought I was overthinking it—but that 18-month wait saved me $43,200 compared to refinancing immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I tracked every month: comparable home sales in my neighborhood, refinancing interest rate changes, my credit score improvement, and equity position evolution. I built a decision matrix showing when refinancing timing was optimal versus suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiting paid off. My home appreciated from $410,000 to $485,000 while rates dropped from 7.50% to 6.75% and my credit improved from 692 to 718. Refinancing at month 18 versus month 1 gave me $32,000 more cash-out access at 0.75% lower rate with better credit pricing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
