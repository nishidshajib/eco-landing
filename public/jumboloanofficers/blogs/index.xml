I learned the hard way that the selection cycle matters as much as the rate sheet. My household carries income from a tech salary, venture distributions, and vesting stock, so documentation sprawl kills momentum. I decided to run a 14-day sprint to identify an officer who could keep up. Here is what I documented for every step so you can reuse the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How We Kept Our Jumbo Underwriting Review Calm</title><link>https://jumboloanofficers.com/blogs/how-we-kept-our-jumbo-underwriting-review-calm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 11:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jumboloanofficers.com/blogs/how-we-kept-our-jumbo-underwriting-review-calm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Jumbo underwriting reviews are famous for derailing strong borrowers. Between reserve requirements, concentrated stock positions, and appraisal scrutiny, even well-paid households can feel shaky. My partner and I recently closed on a $2.8 million primary residence while juggling IPO lockups and relocation reimbursements. We promised ourselves the review would stay calm, so we reverse engineered the process into six checkpoints. Use our notes to shorten your own stress cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-rebuild-the-financial-narrative"&gt;1. Rebuild the financial narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped thinking in terms of “documents” and started thinking in terms of chapters. Chapter one covered base salary, bonuses, and deferred comp. Chapter two summarized equity: RSUs, ESPP holdings, and privately held shares. Chapter three captured passive income from rentals and syndications. Each chapter opened with a one-page narrative that gave the underwriter context before they flipped through PDFs. The clarity alone removed three rounds of questions because our officer always had a cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Luxury Appraisal Gap Playbook for Seven-Figure Buyers</title><link>https://jumboloanofficers.com/blogs/luxury-appraisal-gap-playbook-for-seven-figure-buyers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 14:10:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jumboloanofficers.com/blogs/luxury-appraisal-gap-playbook-for-seven-figure-buyers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Appraisal gaps are awkward when you are buying an $800,000 starter home. They become existential when you are negotiating a $3 million estate with a boutique lender watching every dollar of collateral. We recently fought—and won—an appraisal gap dispute that could have derailed our purchase. Here is the playbook we built so other high-balance buyers can walk into valuation week confident instead of reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="build-the-valuation-package-before-the-appraiser-is-assigned"&gt;Build the valuation package before the appraiser is assigned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a 20-page valuation brief the same week we went under contract. It included neighborhood sales, pocket listings, pending transactions, and private sales sourced through our agent’s network. We annotated every comp with adjustments for views, outdoor space, smart-home upgrades, and school zones. When the lender finally assigned an appraiser, we sent the brief through the loan officer so the document became part of the official work file. The appraiser thanked us for saving hours of research and referenced our notes several times in the final report.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
