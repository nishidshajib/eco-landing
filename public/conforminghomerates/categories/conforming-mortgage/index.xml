Reality: my file blended salary, quarterly bonuses, RSUs, and freelance invoices. The underwriter came back with a polite essay of conditions that basically said, “Prove every dollar twice.” I could have grumbled about the workload, but our rate lock window was ticking.

Then I watched a lender reprice three times in one week, wiping out every savings estimate I had shared with my spouse. I promised our family I would never stumble through rate shopping again.
