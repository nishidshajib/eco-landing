The first time, she used Wells Fargo (her bank) and got 4.25% when the market average was 3.875%. The second time, she used a credit union and got 3.125% when the market was 3.25%—a great deal. The third time, she used a mortgage broker and got 2.625% when the market was 2.75%—the best deal of all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same borrower, similar market conditions, but three completely different experiences and outcomes. The lender type mattered more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
