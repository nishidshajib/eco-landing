That unique perspective showed me something most borrowers never see: the pricing models are so fundamentally different that comparing &amp;ldquo;rates&amp;rdquo; between big banks, small lenders, and brokers is almost meaningless without context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big bank quoting 6.25% and a mortgage broker quoting 6.0% for the &amp;ldquo;same&amp;rdquo; loan are actually offering completely different products with different cost structures, service models, and long-term implications. Understanding these differences is worth tens of thousands of dollars to you as a borrower—and might change which lender type you choose entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mortgage Brokers vs Banks vs Credit Unions: Which Lender Type Saves You the Most Money in 2025?</title><link>https://www.mtglenders.com/blogs/mortgage-brokers-vs-banks-vs-credit-unions-which-lender-type-saves-you-the-most-money-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mtglenders.com/blogs/mortgage-brokers-vs-banks-vs-credit-unions-which-lender-type-saves-you-the-most-money-in-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My sister-in-law refinanced her mortgage three times in the past decade. The first time, she used Wells Fargo (her bank) and got 4.25% when the market average was 3.875%. The second time, she used a credit union and got 3.125% when the market was 3.25%—a great deal. The third time, she used a mortgage broker and got 2.625% when the market was 2.75%—the best deal of all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same borrower, similar market conditions, but three completely different experiences and outcomes. The lender type mattered more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
