&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My first question:&lt;/strong&gt; Is that a jumbo loan or conforming loan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer:&lt;/strong&gt; In Orange County, the 2024 conforming loan limit is $1,089,300—so my $825,000 purchase qualified as conforming, not jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard conforming limit (2024):&lt;/strong&gt; $766,550 in most U.S. counties&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Saved $42,000 by Understanding My County's $1.09M Conforming Limit: Jumbo vs. High-Balance Conforming</title><link>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/i-saved-42000-by-understanding-my-countys-1.09m-conforming-limit-jumbo-vs.-high-balance-conforming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/i-saved-42000-by-understanding-my-countys-1.09m-conforming-limit-jumbo-vs.-high-balance-conforming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When my husband and I were transferred to Seattle for work in early 2024, we started looking at homes in the Eastside suburbs—Bellevue, Redmond, Sammamish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sticker shock was real:&lt;/strong&gt; Entry-level 3-bedroom homes started at $900,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from Ohio where we&amp;rsquo;d owned a nice 4-bedroom home for $320,000, we assumed a $950,000 mortgage would require jumbo financing with all the associated costs—higher rates, larger down payment, deeper reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
