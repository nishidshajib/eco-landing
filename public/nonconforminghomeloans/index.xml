&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income: $385,000 combined (tech industry, both W-2 employees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit scores: 710 (me), 728 (wife)—lenders use lower score for qualification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings: $320,000 (15% down + closing costs + reserves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current housing: Renting 2BR apartment at $3,200/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt: $1,850/month (two car payments $1,200, student loans $650)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key question:&lt;/strong&gt; Should we buy now with my 710 credit score, or wait 4-6 months to improve my score to 740+ for better jumbo rates?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I'm Self-Employed Making $180K Gross But Only $62K Taxable: How Bank Statement Loans Saved My Home Purchase</title><link>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/im-self-employed-making-180k-gross-but-only-62k-taxable-how-bank-statement-loans-saved-my-home-purchase/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/im-self-employed-making-180k-gross-but-only-62k-taxable-how-bank-statement-loans-saved-my-home-purchase/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve owned a digital marketing agency since 2019. My business does well—I gross around $180,000 per year as a sole proprietor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the problem: After legitimate business deductions (home office, equipment, software subscriptions, vehicle expenses, health insurance, retirement contributions), my &lt;strong&gt;taxable income on my tax returns is only $62,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I applied for a conventional mortgage in March 2024, every lender rejected me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; They use my tax return income ($62,000) to qualify me—which only approved me for $235,000 mortgage. I needed $625,000 to buy the home I wanted in my target neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jumbo Loans vs. Conforming: I Compared Both for My $825K Home Purchase and Here's What I Learned</title><link>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/jumbo-loans-vs.-conforming-i-compared-both-for-my-825k-home-purchase-and-heres-what-i-learned/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/jumbo-loans-vs.-conforming-i-compared-both-for-my-825k-home-purchase-and-heres-what-i-learned/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I started house hunting in Orange County, California in early 2024, I quickly learned that $825,000 was the baseline for single-family homes in decent neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My first question:&lt;/strong&gt; Is that a jumbo loan or conforming loan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer:&lt;/strong&gt; In Orange County, the 2024 conforming loan limit is $1,089,300—so my $825,000 purchase qualified as conforming, not jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;

After 35 years of diligent saving and investing, my wife and I had accumulated $3.2 million in retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, and other liquid assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we decided to relocate from Boston to Naples, Florida in early 2024, we found the perfect $1.15 million home near the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&amp;rsquo;t had W-2 income since 2022.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our financial situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combined income: $420,000/year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings: $220,000 (enough for 10% down + closing + reserves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit scores: 724 (me), 738 (husband)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current housing: Renting townhome at $3,800/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The math:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% down on $1.6M = $320,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had only $220,000 saved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortfall: $100,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m also self-employed running a consulting business, which makes my tax returns look terrible for traditional mortgage qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My 2023 tax return showed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross business revenue: $145,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net taxable income after deductions: $38,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rental income reported: $42,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rental expenses reported: $38,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net rental income on tax returns:&lt;/strong&gt; $3,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on paper, I earn $38,000 + $3,500 = &lt;strong&gt;$41,500/year&lt;/strong&gt; ($3,458/month).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Saved $42,000 by Understanding My County's $1.09M Conforming Limit: Jumbo vs. High-Balance Conforming</title><link>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/i-saved-42000-by-understanding-my-countys-1.09m-conforming-limit-jumbo-vs.-high-balance-conforming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/i-saved-42000-by-understanding-my-countys-1.09m-conforming-limit-jumbo-vs.-high-balance-conforming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When my husband and I were transferred to Seattle for work in early 2024, we started looking at homes in the Eastside suburbs—Bellevue, Redmond, Sammamish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sticker shock was real:&lt;/strong&gt; Entry-level 3-bedroom homes started at $900,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from Ohio where we&amp;rsquo;d owned a nice 4-bedroom home for $320,000, we assumed a $950,000 mortgage would require jumbo financing with all the associated costs—higher rates, larger down payment, deeper reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jumbo Loan Denied at 695 Credit: I Improved to 742 in 5 Months and Saved $87,000 on My $1.4M Purchase</title><link>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/jumbo-loan-denied-at-695-credit-i-improved-to-742-in-5-months-and-saved-87000-on-my-1.4m-purchase/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nonconforminghomeloans.com/blogs/jumbo-loan-denied-at-695-credit-i-improved-to-742-in-5-months-and-saved-87000-on-my-1.4m-purchase/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, my wife and I found our dream home in Scottsdale, Arizona—a beautiful 4-bedroom with a pool listed at $1.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had our finances in order: $375,000 saved for down payment (25% plus closing costs), combined income of $380,000, and stable employment. We felt confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I checked my credit score: 695.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I applied with three jumbo lenders. All three rejected me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Credit score below minimum for jumbo financing. Minimum 700 required.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
