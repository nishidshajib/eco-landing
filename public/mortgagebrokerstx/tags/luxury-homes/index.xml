&lt;p&gt;Texas luxury real estate markets—Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio—increasingly require jumbo mortgages. Jumbo loans exceed the 2024 Fannie Mae conforming limit of $766,200, allowing homebuyers to finance luxury properties without government-backed pricing limitations. However, jumbo financing requires specialist lenders and broker expertise to secure competitive rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A jumbo mortgage is a loan exceeding Fannie Mae&amp;rsquo;s conforming loan limit ($766,200 in 2024; limits vary by county). Jumbo loans do not carry government insurance, requiring lenders to accept more risk and impose stricter qualification requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
