      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-mortgage-brokers-shop-rates-in-texas---get-better-pricing-without-bank-limits&#34;&gt;How Mortgage Brokers Shop Rates in Texas - Get Better Pricing Without Bank Limits&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage brokers are licensed professionals who connect borrowers with multiple lenders, shopping rates and terms to find your best option. In Texas, mortgage brokers represent one of the most effective ways to access competitive pricing and specialized loan programs without being limited to a single bank&amp;rsquo;s products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-makes-mortgage-brokers-different-from-banks-and-direct-lenders&#34;&gt;What Makes Mortgage Brokers Different From Banks and Direct Lenders&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Banks and direct lenders are single-source options. When you apply with Chase, Wells Fargo, or a regional bank, you get access only to their loan products, pricing, and underwriting standards. If their rate doesn&amp;rsquo;t match competitors, you have no recourse beyond applying elsewhere—costing you additional hard inquiries and documentation requests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
