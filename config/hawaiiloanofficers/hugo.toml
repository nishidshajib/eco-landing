  faq1Question = "Do Hawaii loan officers charge higher fees than mainland lenders?"
  faq1Answer = "Hawaii loan officer fees are comparable to mainland rates, but some lenders add island-specific charges for appraisals and unique property types. Compare Loan Estimates from 3+ loan officers to evaluate total costs. Broker loan officers often deliver lower APR through wholesale lender access."

  faq2Question = "Which island has the best mortgage rates in Hawaii?"
  faq2Answer = "Oahu typically offers the most competitive rates due to lender competition and higher transaction volume. Maui, Kauai, and Big Island rates may be 0.125%–0.25% higher for second homes and unique properties. Work with island-specialized loan officers for best pricing."

  faq3Question = "How do second-home rates differ from primary residence in Hawaii?"
  faq3Answer = "Second homes in Hawaii carry 0.375%–0.750% rate premiums depending on property type, island, and lender. Jumbo second homes require larger down payments (20%–30%) and higher credit scores (720+). Loan officers experienced in second-home pricing help minimize premiums."

  faq4Question = "What credit score do I need for a Hawaii jumbo loan?"
  faq4Answer = "Jumbo loans in Hawaii typically require 700+ credit scores for competitive pricing, with 720+ preferred for second homes and luxury properties. Portfolio lenders may accept 680+ with higher rates and down payments. Check your middle credit score at MiddleCreditScore.com before applying."

  faq5Question = "Can I use a mainland loan officer for Hawaii properties?"
  faq5Answer = "Mainland loan officers can originate Hawaii loans if NMLS-licensed in Hawaii, but island-specialized loan officers provide better property expertise, appraisal knowledge, and lender relationships. Local expertise prevents closing delays and pricing surprises."

  faq6Question = "How do I verify a Hawaii loan officer's NMLS license?"
  faq6Answer = "Visit NMLSConsumerAccess.org and search by loan officer name or NMLS number. Verify active Hawaii license, employment history, and any regulatory actions. All Hawaii loan officers must maintain NMLS licensing and state registration."
