  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a construction-to-permanent loan?'
  faq1Answer = '''A construction-to-permanent loan (also called a one-time close construction loan) finances both the construction phase and the permanent mortgage in a single loan with one closing. You lock your interest rate before construction starts, make interest-only payments during the build, and the loan converts to a traditional mortgage when construction is complete. Connect with verified construction loan officers through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> to compare construction-to-permanent options.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = '''What's the difference between a construction loan and a traditional mortgage?'''
  faq2Answer = '''Construction loans fund the building process with money released in stages (draws) as construction progresses—requiring interest-only payments during construction and converting to principal + interest after completion. Traditional mortgages fund completed homes with fixed monthly principal and interest payments from day one. Construction loans have higher rates, stricter requirements, and more complexity than traditional purchase loans.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'Do I need 20% down for a construction loan?'
  faq3Answer = '''Most construction loans require 10-20% down, though some lenders offer construction-to-permanent financing with as little as 5% down for qualified buyers. Larger down payments reduce construction loan rates and improve approval odds. If you own a home with equity, you can use <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> proceeds as your down payment for new construction financing.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'How does my credit score affect construction loan rates?'
  faq4Answer = '''Construction loan officers use your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to determine rate pricing. Construction loans typically require 680+ credit for approval, with 720+ scores qualifying for the best rates. Lower scores face higher rates and stricter down payment requirements. Understanding your middle score before applying helps you set realistic expectations and improve your score if needed to unlock better construction financing terms.'''
