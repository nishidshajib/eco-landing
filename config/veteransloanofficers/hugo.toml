  # FAQ Section
  faqTitle = 'Frequently Asked Questions About VA Loans & VA Loan Officers'
  faqSubtitle = 'Common questions about VA home loans, eligibility, and finding the right VA loan officer'
  
  faq1Question = 'What credit score do I need for a VA loan?'
  faq1Answer = 'VA does not set minimum credit scores—lenders do. Some VA specialists approve 580 scores while big banks require 620-640 minimums. Your middle credit score (the median of your three bureau FICO scores) determines rate pricing and approval odds. Lenders use the middle score for qualification, so if you have 720/695/680 across bureaus, they use 695. Check your middle score at MiddleCreditScore.com to understand which VA lenders will approve your profile before applying.'
  
  faq2Question = 'Can I use my VA loan more than once?'
  faq2Answer = 'Yes, absolutely. VA entitlement is reusable throughout your lifetime. If you sell a home purchased with a VA loan, your entitlement restores fully and you can use it again for another zero-down purchase. You can even have two VA loans simultaneously using second-tier entitlement if you have sufficient remaining entitlement. Many veterans mistakenly believe VA loans are one-time benefits—they are not. VA loan officers who specialize in military lending help calculate remaining entitlement and structure multiple VA purchases correctly.'
  
  faq3Question = 'What is residual income and why does it matter for VA loans?'
  faq3Answer = 'Residual income is the money left after paying all debts, taxes, and estimated living expenses. VA uses residual income tables (based on family size, loan amount, and region) rather than strict DTI limits to evaluate affordability. You might have a 50% DTI but still qualify if residual income exceeds VA requirements for your situation. For example, a family of four in the West region needs $1,117+ monthly residual income. This is why VA specialists approve borrowers with high DTIs that conventional lenders deny—residual income matters more than ratios.'
  
  faq4Question = 'Do I have to pay the VA funding fee if I have a disability rating?'
  faq4Answer = 'No. Veterans receiving VA disability compensation at 10% or higher are exempt from the VA funding fee, as are surviving spouses receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). The funding fee ranges from 1.25% to 3.3% of the loan amount, so exemptions save $2,500-$15,000+ depending on loan size and down payment. Many veterans with disability ratings do not realize they qualify for exemption—VA loan officers verify eligibility and ensure exemptions are claimed properly, saving thousands.'
  
  faq5Question = 'Can I get a VA loan while I am deployed or overseas?'
  faq5Answer = 'Yes. VA loans are designed for active duty service members, including those deployed. VA loan officers who specialize in military lending work with deployed borrowers regularly, handling document signing via power of attorney, electronic signatures, or delayed closings coordinated around deployment schedules. They also understand how to document BAH income, LES statements, and military pay structures that confuse generic lenders. If you are deployed and want to buy or refinance, find a VA specialist experienced with military deployment scenarios.'
  
  faq6Question = 'What is the difference between a VA IRRRL and a VA cash-out refinance?'
  faq6Answer = 'An IRRRL (Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan), also called a VA Streamline Refinance, lowers your existing VA loan rate without income verification, appraisal, or extensive documentation in most cases. You cannot pull cash out with an IRRRL—it only reduces your rate or switches from adjustable to fixed. A VA cash-out refinance allows you to refinance any existing loan (VA, conventional, FHA) into a new VA loan and pull equity out at up to 100% LTV. Cash-out requires full income documentation and appraisal but delivers cash for any purpose plus no PMI regardless of LTV.'
