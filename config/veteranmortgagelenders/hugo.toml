  faqTitle = 'Questions VA Buyers Ask Daily'
  faqSubtitle = 'Here are the answers we repeat most.'

  faq1Question = 'How soon should I request my COE?'
  faq1Answer = 'Request it the moment you decide to explore listings, not when you are ready to write an offer. Upload it with LES samples, ID, disability letters, and prior VA loan payoff statements so lenders can validate entitlement within hours. Refresh it after major life events—new duty station, marriage, or a refinance—so no one questions whether the data is current.'

  faq2Question = 'Does residual income matter more than DTI?'
  faq2Answer = 'Both matter, but residual income is the VA-specific pass/fail metric that underwriters cite when they pause files. We map it by region, family size, BAH, COLA, and childcare costs, then show how those numbers shift if you change the loan amount or add a co-borrower. When your tracker proves you exceed the threshold even during PCS overlap months, DTI debates tend to disappear.'

  faq3Question = 'How do I prep for Tidewater?'
  faq3Answer = 'Stage a digital folder with recent comps, renovation receipts, neighborhood upgrades, and any concessions already negotiated before the appraiser arrives. Share that packet with your agent so everyone can respond the minute a Tidewater notice hits. Because you already drafted the narrative, the rebuttal becomes an organized email instead of a frantic scramble.'

  faq4Question = 'Can I buy while deployed?'
  faq4Answer = 'Yes, but you need an executed power of attorney, a spouse or trusted proxy who can attend walk-throughs, and a clear occupancy timeline that satisfies VA guidelines. We script how to explain the arrangement to listing agents, outline which documents the proxy signs, and document travel plans so the underwriter knows when you will occupy the property. When everyone sees dates, orders, and communications in writing, those approvals move forward smoothly.'
