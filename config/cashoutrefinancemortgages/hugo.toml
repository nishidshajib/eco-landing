  faq1Question = 'How much equity do I need for cash-out refinance?'
  faq1Answer = '''Conventional cash-out refinance requires 20%+ equity (refinance up to 80% LTV). FHA cash-out allows 20%+ equity (up to 80% LTV) after 12 months ownership. VA cash-out allows 10%+ equity for veterans (up to 90% LTV) or even 100% LTV with perfect credit. Example: $400K home with $250K mortgage = $150K equity (37.5% equity position) = can access up to $70K cash at 80% LTV ($320K new loan). Check your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to determine which program offers best cash-out rates, then connect with specialists at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> for equity access calculations.'''
  
  faq2Question = 'Is cash-out refinance rate higher than regular refinance?'
  faq2Answer = '''Yes, cash-out refinance rates are typically 0.125-0.375% higher than rate-and-term refinance on same credit tier. Example: 720 credit rate-and-term = 6.375%, 720 credit cash-out = 6.625-6.75%. The rate premium reflects higher lender risk with cash-out transactions. Over 5 years on $300K loan, 0.25% rate difference = $3,750 additional interest cost. Cash-out makes financial sense when equity access benefits (debt consolidation savings, investment returns, home value increase) exceed this rate premium cost. Calculate your specific scenario at <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Cash-Out Refinance calculators</a>.'''
  
  faq3Question = 'When does debt consolidation through cash-out refinance make sense?'
  faq3Answer = '''Cash-out refinance for debt consolidation makes financial sense when: (1) high-interest debt (credit cards 18-24%, personal loans 10-15%) exceeds cash-out refinance rate by 4%+ margin, (2) you plan to stay in home 5+ years to recoup closing costs, (3) you have financial discipline to not re-accumulate credit card debt after payoff. Example: $60K credit card debt at 21% = $12,600/year interest. Cash-out at 7% = $4,200/year interest = $8,400 annual savings. But extending 5-year debt into 30-year mortgage increases total interest—breakeven occurs at year 7-8 typically. Connect with debt consolidation specialists at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> for complete analysis before refinancing.'''
  
  faq4Question = 'How does credit score affect cash-out refinance rates and LTV limits?'
  faq4Answer = '''Credit score affects both cash-out refinance rates and maximum LTV ratios. Rate tiers: 620-639 credit = 7.50-8.00% typical, 640-679 credit = 7.00-7.50%, 680-719 credit = 6.50-7.00%, 720-739 credit = 6.25-6.75%, 740+ credit = 6.00-6.50%. LTV limits: 620-639 credit = 70-75% max LTV on cash-out, 640-679 credit = 75-80% max LTV, 680+ credit = 80% max LTV standard. Improving credit 40-60 points (660→720) can save $9,000-$12,000 over 5 years on $300K cash-out refinance and increase equity access by $15,000-$30,000 through higher LTV approval.
