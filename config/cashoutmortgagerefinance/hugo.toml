  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is cash-out refinancing and how does it differ from regular refinancing?'
  faq1Answer = 'Cash-out refinancing replaces your existing mortgage with a larger loan, allowing you to receive the difference in cash. Unlike rate-and-term refinancing (which only changes your rate or term), cash-out refinancing increases your loan balance to access home equity. Most lenders allow up to 80% LTV for conventional loans, though VA loans may permit up to 100% for eligible veterans.'
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What credit score do I need for cash-out refinancing?'
  faq2Answer = 'Most conventional cash-out refinance lenders require a minimum credit score of 620, though scores of 680+ typically unlock the best rates and terms. Understanding your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> is crucial, as lenders use your mid-score among all three bureaus to determine cash-out refinance eligibility and pricing.'
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'How much equity do I need to qualify for cash-out refinancing?'
  faq3Answer = 'Most lenders require at least 20% equity remaining after cash-out refinancing, meaning you can access up to 80% of your home value. For example, if your home is worth $400,000, you could potentially refinance up to $320,000. VA loans offer more flexibility, sometimes allowing up to 100% LTV for eligible veterans. Compare options through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" target="_blank">Cash-OutRefinance.com</a>.'
