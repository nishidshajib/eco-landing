  faqTitle = 'Texas Mortgage Broker Questions'

  faq1Question = 'What do mortgage brokers charge in Texas?'
  faq1Answer = 'Brokers charge either origination fees (1%) paid by you or lender fees paid by the lender. Most borrowers prefer lender-paid compensation—the broker shops lenders and you pay nothing extra. Compare total costs (broker fees + lender origination fees) across offers to evaluate true pricing.'

  faq2Question = 'How long does mortgage broker shopping take in Texas?'
  faq2Answer = 'Typical timeline is 30-45 days from application to closing. Brokers can accelerate with portfolio lenders (15-20 days) or extend timelines if you need time to improve credit, save down payment, or coordinate with a home purchase.'

  faq3Question = 'Can brokers get better rates than direct lenders?'
  faq3Answer = 'Yes, brokers access lenders most homebuyers never find—portfolio banks, credit unions, jumbo specialists—exposing you to wider pricing. Brokers also leverage relationships for priority processing and rate discounts. Comparing broker offers to direct lender offers typically favors the broker.'

  faq4Question = 'How do I know if a broker is legitimate in Texas?'
  faq4Answer = 'Verify licensing through the Texas Workforce Commission and NMLS. Ask for references, compare competing offers with written terms, and avoid brokers who guarantee rates or pressure quick decisions. Transparent brokers provide clear fee breakdowns and explain why their offer is competitive.'

  faq5Question = 'Do mortgage brokers work with borrowers with bad credit?'
  faq5Answer = 'Yes, brokers access FHA, non-QM, and portfolio lenders who approve scores below 620. Brokers often help credit strategies before applying—disputing errors, paying collections strategically—to maximize approval odds and improve rates.'

  faq6Question = 'Can brokers help with jumbo mortgages in Texas?'
  faq6Answer = 'Yes, Texas brokers specialize in jumbo financing for luxury markets like Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Brokers access portfolio lenders and jumbo specialists with competitive rates, portfolio flexibility, and faster approvals than traditional banks.'
