  faq1Question = "What's the difference between a loan officer and a mortgage broker?"
  faq1Answer = "Loan officers work for a single lender and can only offer that lender's programs. Brokers access multiple lenders and wholesale programs, often offering better pricing. Both must be NMLS-licensed. Arizona borrowers often get better rates from brokers with portfolio and wholesale relationships."

  faq2Question = "How do I verify an Arizona loan officer's NMLS license?"
  faq2Answer = "Visit NMLSConsumerAccess.org and search for the individual's name and NMLS number. Look for active license, state authorization (Arizona), and any regulatory actions or complaints."

  faq3Question = "Should I use a loan officer from Phoenix, Scottsdale, or my local market?"
  faq3Answer = "Market specialization matters. Phoenix loan officers have abundant lender competition. Scottsdale specialists understand luxury and jumbo programming. Chandler experts navigate new construction. Choose specialists in your specific market."

  faq4Question = "Do Arizona loan officers charge fees?"
  faq4Answer = "Loan officers don't charge direct fees; they earn commission from lenders. However, origination fees, processing fees, and points come from loan proceeds or out-of-pocket. Brokers often offer lower fees than direct bank loan officers."

  faq5Question = "How much can an Arizona loan officer help with rates?"
  faq5Answer = "Experienced loan officers with multiple lender relationships can save 0.125–0.50% in rate and APR compared to direct bank applications. Savings increase for complex scenarios (jumbo, new construction, complex income)."

  faq6Question = "What questions should I ask an Arizona loan officer?"
  faq6Answer = "Ask: (1) What lenders do you access? (2) How many jumbo/portfolio lenders? (3) What's your closing timeline? (4) Will you compare rates across lenders? (5) What's your experience in my market? Experienced officers answer specifically."
