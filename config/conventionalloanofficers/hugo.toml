  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What credit score do I need for a conventional loan?'
  faq1Answer = '''Most lenders require a minimum 620 credit score for conventional loans, though some may go as low as 580 with compensating factors. For the best rates and lowest PMI costs, aim for 740+. Your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> (the median of your three bureau scores) is what loan officers use for approval and pricing.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'How much down payment do I need for a conventional loan?'
  faq2Answer = '''Conventional loans accept down payments as low as 3% for first-time buyers and 5% for repeat buyers. However, putting down less than 20% requires Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). The more you put down, the lower your monthly payment and PMI costs. Many borrowers target 20% down to avoid PMI entirely.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = '''What's the difference between conventional and FHA loans?'''
  faq3Answer = '''Conventional loans are not government-insured and typically require higher credit scores (620+ vs. 580 for FHA) but offer more flexibility and lower costs for borrowers with strong credit. FHA loans have lower down payment options but require upfront and annual mortgage insurance that can't be removed without refinancing. Conventional PMI can be cancelled once you reach 20% equity.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Can I use a conventional loan to refinance and take cash out?'
  faq4Answer = '''Yes, conventional <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" target="_blank">cash-out refinancing</a> allows you to access your home equity while replacing your current mortgage. You can typically borrow up to 80% of your home's value (some lenders allow 85-90% with higher rates). This is ideal for debt consolidation, home improvements, or other financial needs.'''
