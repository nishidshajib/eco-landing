  # FAQ Section
  faqTitle = 'Frequently Asked Questions About Refinancing'
  faqSubtitle = 'Common questions about mortgage refinancing and home equity access'
  
  faq1Question = 'When does refinancing make financial sense?'
  faq1Answer = 'Refinancing makes sense when you can lower your rate enough to recoup closing costs within your planned ownership period. As a general rule, if you can reduce your rate by 0.5-0.75% or more and you plan to stay in your home at least 2-3 years, refinancing likely saves money. Calculate your specific break-even point by dividing closing costs by monthly savings. Also consider refinancing to remove mortgage insurance, switch from adjustable to fixed rates, or access equity for strategic purposes even if rates are similar.'
  
  faq2Question = 'What is the difference between cash-out refinance and HELOC?'
  faq2Answer = 'Cash-out refinancing replaces your entire mortgage with a new larger loan, giving you the difference in cash. You get a fixed rate and single payment but pay closing costs on the full loan amount. HELOCs provide a revolving credit line using your equity as collateral, typically with variable rates and interest-only payments during the draw period. Cash-out refinancing works better when rates are low or you need a large lump sum. HELOCs offer flexibility for ongoing projects or emergency funds. Compare both options at Cash-Out Refinance to determine which strategy minimizes total cost.'
  
  faq3Question = 'How much equity do I need to refinance?'
  faq3Answer = 'Conventional rate-and-term refinancing typically requires at least 3-5% equity (95-97% LTV), though 20% equity avoids mortgage insurance. Cash-out refinancing usually caps at 80% LTV for conventional loans, meaning you need at least 20% equity and can access the difference between 80% LTV and your current loan balance. FHA cash-out allows 80% LTV with seasoning requirements. VA cash-out can go to 90% LTV for qualified veterans. Higher equity positions always qualify for better rates and more flexible terms across all refinance programs.'
  
  faq4Question = 'How long does refinancing take and what documents do I need?'
  faq4Answer = 'Standard refinancing takes 30-45 days from application to closing, though streamline programs (FHA Streamline, VA IRRRL) can close in 15-30 days with reduced documentation. You will need recent pay stubs, W-2s, tax returns, bank statements, homeowners insurance declarations, and mortgage statements. If you are doing cash-out refinancing, lenders scrutinize income and assets more carefully since you are increasing your loan balance. Your credit will be pulled again near closing to ensure nothing has changed. Working with experienced refinance loan officers who pre-screen your documentation before submitting your application prevents delays and ensures smooth processing.'
