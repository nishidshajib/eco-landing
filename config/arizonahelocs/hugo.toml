  faq1Question = "What is a HELOC and how does it work?"
  faq1Answer = "HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) is a flexible loan backed by your home equity. Draw funds as needed during draw period (5-10 years), pay interest-only on amounts drawn. Repayment period (15-20 years) follows where you pay principal + interest. Works like credit card backed by home."

  faq2Question = "How much can I borrow with an Arizona HELOC?"
  faq2Answer = "Most lenders allow 80-85% Loan-to-Value (LTV). Example: $400K home with $300K mortgage = $100K equity; HELOC available up to $80K (80% LTV). Actual amount depends on lender, credit score, income, and equity available."

  faq3Question = "What are current Arizona HELOC rates?"
  faq3Answer = "Arizona HELOC rates currently range 7.5-10% (as of early 2026) depending on credit score, equity %, lender. Excellent credit (740+): 7.5-8.5%. Good credit (680-739): 8.0-8.75%. Fair credit (620-679): 8.5-9.5%. Compare multiple lenders for best rates."

  faq4Question = "How long does Arizona HELOC approval take?"
  faq4Answer = "Pre-approval typically 3-5 business days. Full approval 5-7 days. Funding typically 7-10 days after closing. Some lenders offer faster processing if documents organized."

  faq5Question = "What credit score do I need for a HELOC in Arizona?"
  faq5Answer = "Minimum credit score usually 620. Best rates at 740+. Fair credit (620-679) approved with higher rates and possibly lower equity access (70-80% LTV vs 85%)."

  faq6Question = "Can I use HELOC funds for anything?"
  faq6Answer = "Yes, HELOC funds can be used for home improvements, debt consolidation, education, business capital, medical expenses, or any purpose. Note: HELOC interest is tax-deductible if funds improve your home (consult tax professional)."
