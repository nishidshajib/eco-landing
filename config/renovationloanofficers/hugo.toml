  faq1Question = 'What is the difference between FHA 203(k) and HomeStyle® renovation loans?'
  faq1Answer = '''FHA 203(k) loans are government-insured and allow 3.5% down with flexible credit (typically 620+ for Limited 203k, 640+ for Standard 203k). They are ideal for buying fixer-uppers or major structural repairs but have stricter contractor requirements and HUD consultant oversight. HomeStyle® renovation loans (Fannie Mae) allow higher loan amounts, financing for luxury upgrades and investment properties, and simpler contractor coordination—but typically require 5-20% down and 620-680+ credit depending on loan-to-value. Renovation loan officers through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> help you compare both options based on your renovation scope and financial profile.'''
  
  faq2Question = 'Can I use a renovation loan if I already own my home?'
  faq2Answer = '''Yes—if you already own your home, you can use a <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> to pull equity for renovations, or in some cases a "refinance with renovation" HomeStyle® loan. Cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new larger loan, giving you cash for home improvements. This works well if current rates are competitive or you want to consolidate high-interest debt alongside renovation funding. Your renovation loan officer can compare cash-out refinance vs. HELOC vs. home improvement loans to determine the best financing structure for your remodel.'''
  
  faq3Question = 'How do contractor requirements work for renovation loans?'
  faq3Answer = '''FHA 203(k) loans have strict contractor requirements—contractors must be licensed, insured, and approved by your lender or HUD consultant. Standard 203(k) loans require a HUD consultant to oversee the project, review contractor bids, and manage draw inspections. HomeStyle® renovation loans have more flexible contractor requirements but still need licensed, insured contractors with detailed renovation bids. Cash-out refinance has no specific contractor requirements since you receive cash directly—but renovation loan officers recommend using licensed contractors to protect your investment and ensure quality work.'''
  
  faq4Question = 'How does my credit score affect renovation loan approval and rates?'
  faq4Answer = '''Renovation loan officers use your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to determine rate pricing. FHA 203(k) loans typically require 620-640+ credit (depending on loan type and down payment), while HomeStyle® renovation loans generally need 620-680+ scores. Cash-out refinance requirements vary by lender and loan-to-value but typically need 640-680+ credit. Higher scores (720-740+) qualify for better rates across all renovation loan types. Understanding your middle score before applying helps you set realistic expectations and improve your score if needed to unlock better renovation financing terms.'''
