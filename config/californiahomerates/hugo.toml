  faq2Question = "Why do Bay Area rates beat Inland Empire rates by 0.25%?"
  faq2Answer = "Lender competition. Bay Area has 60+ brokers accessing wholesale lenders; Inland Empire has fewer banks offering retail rates. Brokers anywhere in CA can access same wholesale pricing."

  faq3Question = "Should I lock at application or wait?"
  faq3Answer = "Lock at application for 45 days (+0.125%). California closings average 32 days—30-day locks expire early. Floating saves 0.125% upfront but risks 0.50%+ rate increase."

  faq4Question = "Is APR or rate more important on California loans?"
  faq4Answer = "APR includes fees. California lenders charge $1,500–3,500 origination fees. 6.375% with $3,500 fees (6.72% APR) costs more than 6.50% with $1,500 fees (6.62% APR). Compare APR."

  faq5Question = "Do California brokers beat banks on jumbo loans?"
  faq5Answer = "Yes. Brokers access 10–20 jumbo lenders (UWM, Pennymac, LoanDepot), banks offer one rate sheet. Brokers save 0.25%–0.50% on California jumbo loans."

  faq6Question = "How much does 0.25% save on a $1M California loan?"
