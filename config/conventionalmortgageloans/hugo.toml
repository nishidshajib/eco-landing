  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a conventional loan and how is it different from government-backed loans?'
  faq1Answer = 'A conventional loan is a mortgage not insured or guaranteed by the federal government, conforming to loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (typically $766,550 in 2024, higher in some areas). Conventional loans finance mainstream homes with flexible qualification requirements, competitive down payment options (as low as 3%), and often lower costs than FHA or VA loans for qualified borrowers.'
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What credit score do I need for a conventional mortgage?'
  faq2Answer = 'Most conventional lenders require a minimum credit score of 620, though scores of 680+ typically unlock the best rates and terms. Understanding your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> is crucial, as lenders use your mid-score among all three bureaus to determine eligibility and pricing for conventional mortgages.'
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'How much down payment is required for a conventional loan?'
  faq3Answer = 'Conventional loans offer flexible down payment options starting as low as 3% for first-time buyers and qualified borrowers. While 20% down eliminates private mortgage insurance (PMI), many homebuyers successfully purchase with smaller down payments. If you already own a home, explore how <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" target="_blank">cash-out refinancing</a> can help you access equity for your next down payment or home improvement projects.'
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Can my employer offer Browse Lenders® access as a benefit?'
