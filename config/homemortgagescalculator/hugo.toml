  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'How accurate are home mortgage calculators for payment estimates?'
  faq1Answer = '''Home mortgage calculators provide accurate payment estimates based on inputs you provide (loan amount, interest rate, term, taxes, insurance, PMI). They use standard amortization formulas matching lender calculations for principal and interest. However, property taxes and insurance vary by location and property value—calculators use typical percentages (1.0-1.5% taxes, 0.3-0.7% insurance) for estimates. PMI calculations match standard pricing (0.5-1.5% of loan amount annually based on down payment percentage). For exact payments, get personalized quotes from lenders with your specific property and credit profile. Our calculators incorporate real-world assumptions providing realistic total housing cost estimates beyond basic P&I calculations showing complete PITI obligations.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'How does my credit score affect my mortgage rate and monthly payment?'
  faq2Answer = '''Lenders use your middle credit score (middle of three bureau scores) to assign mortgage pricing in tiers. Typical tiers: 760+ = best rates (baseline), 740-759 = +0.125% adjustment, 720-739 = +0.25%, 700-719 = +0.375%, 680-699 = +0.5%, 660-679 = +0.75%, 640-659 = +1.0%, below 640 = limited conventional options. Example on $350K loan: 760 credit at 6.5% = $2,212/month, 720 credit at 6.75% = $2,270/month ($58 more), 680 credit at 7.0% = $2,329/month ($117 more). Over 30 years, the 680 vs 760 difference costs $42,120 extra in total payments. Improving credit before applying saves significant money—crossing from 679 to 680 threshold alone saves thousands. Use our credit impact calculator to model exact payment differences across score ranges and determine whether delaying purchase for credit improvement makes financial sense.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage for my home?'
  faq3Answer = '''The 15-year versus 30-year decision depends on budget flexibility, financial goals, and long-term planning. 15-year mortgage advantages: Save massive interest (typically 50-60% less total interest), build equity 2x faster, typically 0.5-0.75% lower rate, forced wealth building discipline, own home free-and-clear in half the time. 15-year disadvantages: Higher monthly payment (40-50% more), less cash flow flexibility, reduced ability to invest elsewhere, tighter budget with less emergency cushion. 30-year mortgage advantages: Lower monthly payment, more financial flexibility, opportunity to invest payment difference, easier qualification, better cash flow for emergencies. 30-year disadvantages: Pay significantly more total interest, slower equity building, longer debt commitment. Example: $350K at 6.5% for 30 years = $2,212/month ($446,320 interest), same loan at 6.0% for 15 years = $2,953/month ($181,540 interest), saves $264,780 but costs $741 more monthly. Choose 15-year if you have stable income and want aggressive debt payoff. Choose 30-year if you value flexibility or plan to invest the payment difference strategically.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'When does refinancing make financial sense for mortgage savings?'
  faq4Answer = '''Refinancing makes financial sense when interest savings cover closing costs within 2-3 years and you plan to stay in the home long enough to benefit. General rule: 0.75-1.0% rate reduction justifies refinancing for most situations. Calculate breakeven: Closing costs ÷ monthly savings = months to break even. Example: Current loan $350K at 7.5%, refinance to 6.5% = monthly savings $244. If closing costs are $7,000, breakeven = $7,000 ÷ $244 = 29 months (2.4 years). If you plan to stay 5+ years, refinancing saves $14,640 over remaining term after recovering closing costs. Factors affecting refinancing decision: Rate difference (minimum 0.75% recommended), closing costs (typically 2-3% of loan amount), time remaining on current loan (more years = more savings potential), credit score improvement (better credit = better refi rate), home equity increase (80% LTV or better avoids PMI). Use our refinance calculator to model exact breakeven timeline and total savings based on your specific situation before deciding.'''
