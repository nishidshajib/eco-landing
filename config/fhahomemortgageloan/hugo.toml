If your credit score is 580-619, FHA requires 10% down payment—on a $200,000 home, that's $20,000 vs. $7,000 (a $13,000 difference). Check your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to see which tier you qualify for.'''
  
  faq2Question = 'How much is FHA mortgage insurance and can I remove it?'
  faq2Answer = '''FHA mortgage insurance has two parts: Upfront MI (1.75% of loan amount, typically financed) and Annual MI (0.55-0.85% of loan balance, paid monthly). Total first-year MI cost on $250,000 loan: $4,375 upfront + $2,000 annual = $6,375. To eliminate MI: refinance to conventional loan once you reach 20% equity and 620+ credit through <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">refinance strategies</a>.'''
  
  faq3Question = 'Can I use gift funds for my FHA down payment and closing costs?'
  faq3Answer = '''Yes, FHA allows 100% of your down payment and closing costs to come from gift funds (parents, family, employers, nonprofits). Gift funds can be combined with down payment assistance programs—many states offer $5,000-$15,000 grants for first-time buyers.
