  faq2Question = "How do I verify a Wyoming loan officer's license?"
  faq2Answer = "Visit NMLSConsumerAccess.org, enter the loan officer's name or NMLS number, verify active Wyoming license and check disciplinary history. All WY loan officers must maintain NMLS licensing."

  faq3Question = "Do Wyoming loan officers charge fees?"
  faq3Answer = "Loan officers earn via borrower-paid fees (1%–2% origination) or lender-paid compensation. Ask: 'What's your compensation structure?' Transparent MLOs explain both options and show rate difference."

  faq4Question = "Which loan officer type is best for rural Wyoming properties?"
  faq4Answer = "Large acreage and ranch properties require portfolio lender access. Brokers with portfolio lender relationships or bank loan officers at Wyoming community banks specializing in rural lending offer best approval odds."

  faq5Question = "Why do Wyoming broker rates beat bank rates?"
  faq5Answer = "Wholesale pricing structure—lenders offer 0.125%–0.375% discounts to brokers for volume. The same lender (e.g., Rocket, UWM) charges less through broker wholesale channel than direct retail."

  faq6Question = "Should I interview multiple Wyoming loan officers?"
  faq6Answer = "Yes. Compare 3+ loan officers (mix of brokers and bank MLOs) for rate, fees, and expertise. Wholesale pricing variance and compensation structures create measurable cost differences—worth the comparison effort."
