    answer = "The minimum credit score for most conforming loans is 620. However, borrowers with scores of 680+ typically receive the best rates. If your score is in the middle range (620-679), you can still qualify for competitive conforming loan terms. Visit MiddleCreditScore.com to check your current score and get personalized improvement strategies."

  [[params.sections.faq.items]]  
    question = "How much can I borrow with a conforming loan?"
    answer = "For 2025, the conforming loan limit is $766,550 in most counties, with higher limits up to $1,149,825 in expensive areas. These limits are set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and updated annually based on home price trends."

  [[params.sections.faq.items]]
    question = "What's the difference between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans?"
    answer = "Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that purchase conforming loans from lenders. While their basic requirements are similar, they may have different program names (HomeReady vs. Home Possible) and slightly different qualification guidelines. Your lender will determine which GSE purchases your loan."

  [[params.sections.faq.items]]
    question = "Can I use a conforming loan for investment property?"  
    answer = "Yes, but with different requirements. Investment property conforming loans typically require 20-25% down payment, higher credit scores (usually 640+), and additional cash reserves. The property must still fall within conforming loan limits for your area."

  [[params.sections.faq.items]]
    question = "How do I find the best conforming loan lender?"
    answer = "Compare multiple lenders who specialize in conforming loans for your credit profile. BrowseLenders.com connects you with pre-screened lenders who excel at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs for middle credit score borrowers.
