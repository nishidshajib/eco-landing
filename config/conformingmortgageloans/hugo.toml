  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a conforming loan and how is it different from other mortgages?'
  faq1Answer = 'A conforming loan is a mortgage that meets the lending limits and guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unlike jumbo or non-conforming loans, conforming loans typically offer lower interest rates and more flexible qualification requirements because they can be sold on the secondary mortgage market. In 2025, conforming loan limits vary by county based on local housing costs.'
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What are the current conforming loan limits for 2025?'
  faq2Answer = 'For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is $806,500 for single-family homes in most counties. High-cost areas have higher limits up to $1,209,750. You can explore county-specific conforming loan limits and find lenders through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> to compare options based on your location.'
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'What credit score do I need to qualify for a conforming loan?'
  faq3Answer = 'Most conforming loan lenders require a minimum middle credit score of 620, though better rates and terms are available with scores of 680 or higher. Understanding your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> before applying helps you negotiate better loan terms and avoid unnecessary credit inquiries.'
