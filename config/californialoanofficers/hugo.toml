  faq2Question = "Should I use a mortgage broker or a bank loan officer in California?"
  faq2Answer = "Brokers access multiple lenders (better rate shopping); bank loan officers work for one lender (streamlined process). For competitive California markets, brokers often find better pricing."

  faq3Question = "How many California loan officers should I shop before choosing one?"
  faq3Answer = "Get Loan Estimates from 3–5 loan officers. California rates vary by 0.25%–0.50% between lenders—shopping uncovers $200–500/month savings on large loans."

  faq4Question = "What California-specific programs should my loan officer know?"
  faq4Answer = "CalHFA loans, California Dream For All, high-balance conforming limits ($1,149,825), Prop 13 portability, and local down payment assistance programs (varies by county/city)."

  faq5Question = "Can a California loan officer help with stock compensation underwriting?"
  faq5Answer = "Yes—Bay Area loan officers specialize in tech worker RSUs, stock options, and equity compensation. They count vested stock as reserves and use bank statements for inconsistent income."

  faq6Question = "How do I spot predatory loan officers in California?"
