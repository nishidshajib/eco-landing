  faqSubtitle = 'Clear answers about construction financing, builder loans, draw schedules, and new home build processes.'
  
  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a construction-to-permanent mortgage?'
  faq1Answer = '''A construction-to-permanent mortgage (also called a one-time close construction loan) finances both the construction phase and the permanent mortgage in a single loan with one closing. You lock your interest rate before construction begins, make interest-only payments on drawn funds during the build, and the loan automatically converts to a traditional principal-and-interest mortgage when construction is complete and the certificate of occupancy is issued. Connect with verified construction mortgage brokers through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://browselenders.com" target="_blank">BrowseLenders.com</a> to compare construction-to-permanent options from multiple lenders.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = '''How do construction draw schedules work?'''
  faq2Answer = '''Construction draws release loan funds in stages as your build progresses—typically 4-7 inspections covering foundation, framing, mechanicals, drywall, and final completion. Each draw requires lender inspection to verify work completion before releasing the next percentage of funds. You pay interest only on drawn funds during construction, not the full loan amount. Construction mortgage brokers coordinate draw timing, inspection scheduling, and ensure your builder understands the lender's requirements to prevent funding delays that could stall your build.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'How much down payment do I need for a construction loan?'
  faq3Answer = '''Most construction loans require 10-20% down payment, though some construction-to-permanent programs accept as little as 5% down for qualified borrowers with strong credit and builder relationships. Larger down payments typically reduce construction loan rates and improve approval odds. If you currently own a home with equity, you can use <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://cashoutrefinance.com" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> proceeds as your construction down payment—your construction mortgage broker can structure timing to bridge both transactions.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'How does my credit score affect construction mortgage rates?'
  faq4Answer = '''Construction mortgage brokers use your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to determine rate pricing and approval. Construction loans typically require 680+ credit for approval, with 720+ scores qualifying for best available rates and terms. Lower scores face higher rates, larger down payment requirements, and stricter builder verification. Understanding your middle score before applying helps you set realistic expectations and identify improvement opportunities to unlock better construction financing terms before signing builder contracts.'''
  
  # FAQ 5
  faq5Question = 'What happens if construction delays push my timeline past my rate lock?'
  faq5Answer = '''Extended rate locks for construction loans typically last 6-18 months, but weather delays, permit issues, or material shortages can extend timelines beyond initial projections. If your build timeline exceeds your rate lock, you may need to extend (usually at additional cost) or relock at current market rates—potentially higher than your original lock. Construction mortgage brokers often recommend float-down options that let you capture lower rates if markets improve during construction, while extended locks protect against rate increases. Always build timeline buffer into your construction contract and rate lock period.'''
