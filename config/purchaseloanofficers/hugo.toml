  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a purchase loan?'
  faq1Answer = '''A purchase loan is a mortgage used to buy a home—as opposed to a refinance loan, which replaces an existing mortgage. Purchase loans include conventional mortgages, FHA loans, VA loans, and USDA loans. Each program has different credit requirements, down payment minimums, and qualification standards. Connect with verified purchase loan officers through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> to compare options.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = '''What's the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?'''
  faq2Answer = '''Pre-qualification is an informal estimate based on self-reported income and credit—no verification required. Pre-approval is a formal commitment from a lender based on verified income, assets, and credit reports. Sellers take pre-approved buyers more seriously because pre-approval means you've been underwritten and are ready to close. Always get pre-approved before house hunting.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'How much do I need for a down payment on a purchase loan?'
  faq3Answer = '''Down payment requirements vary by loan type: conventional loans require 3-20%, FHA loans require 3.5%, VA loans require 0% for eligible veterans, and USDA loans require 0% in eligible rural areas. Larger down payments reduce monthly costs and eliminate PMI at 20% down. Learn more about down payment strategies and how they affect affordability through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a>.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'How does my credit score affect purchase loan rates?'
  faq4Answer = '''Purchase loan officers use your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to determine rate pricing. Scores of 740+ qualify for the best rates, while scores between 620-739 face loan-level price adjustments that increase your interest rate. Understanding your middle score before applying helps you set realistic expectations and improve your score if needed to unlock better rates.'''
