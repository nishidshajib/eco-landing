  faqSubtitle = 'Clear answers about refinancing timing and strategic equity access'
  
  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'How do I know if I am ready for cash-out refinancing?'
  faq1Answer = '''Cash-out refinancing readiness requires: (1) Sufficient equity—20%+ after cash-out for conventional (80% LTV), 20% for FHA (80% LTV), 10% for VA (90% LTV). Example: $450K home value needs $360K max loan balance at 80% LTV. Current $280K mortgage allows $80K cash-out access. (2) Credit score qualification—620+ conventional (680+ optimal), 580+ FHA, 620+ VA typical. (3) Income stability—2+ years employment, DTI under 43% conventional (50% FHA). (4) Financial purpose clarity—home improvements, debt consolidation, investment, education (avoid consumption). (5) Rate environment assessment—compare current rate vs refinancing rate impact on total costs. (6) Holding timeline—plan to stay in home 3-5+ years to recover closing costs. Connect with readiness specialists at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> for personalized assessment.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'How much equity can I access with cash-out refinancing?'
  faq2Answer = '''Equity access through cash-out refinancing depends on: (1) Home value (recent appraisal determines current market value and equity position), (2) Loan type maximums—Conventional: 80% LTV max ($400K home = $320K max loan, if current mortgage $240K = $80K cash-out access), FHA: 80% LTV max with MIP required, VA: 90% LTV max for veterans ($400K home = $360K max loan, if current mortgage $240K = $120K cash-out access), (3) Credit score and DTI affect lender overlays—some lenders cap at 75% LTV for middle credit scores or require reserves. Example calculation: $500K home value, $300K current mortgage, 80% LTV = $400K max new loan - $300K current = $100K cash-out available minus closing costs ($7K-10K) = $90K-93K net proceeds. Calculate your equity access at <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Cash-Out Refinance®</a> calculators with LTV optimization scenarios.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'Should I wait for home value to increase before cash-out refinancing?'
  faq3Answer = '''Home value timing for cash-out refinancing depends on: (1) Current equity position vs needs—if you have 40% equity now, waiting for appreciation may not be necessary. If you have 25% equity and need maximum access, waiting for value growth from $400K to $450K increases available cash-out from $20K to $60K at 80% LTV. (2) Market cycle assessment—rapidly appreciating markets (8-12% annual) suggest waiting 12-18 months could significantly increase equity. Flat or declining markets suggest refinancing now if ready. (3) Purpose urgency—time-sensitive needs (business opportunity, high-interest debt consolidation) may justify refinancing at current values rather than waiting. (4) Rate environment—if rates are rising, waiting for appreciation but facing higher rates may negate equity gains. Calculate value appreciation scenarios and rate impact at <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Cash-Out Refinance®</a>. Your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">credit score</a> also affects refinancing costs—sometimes improving credit while waiting for appreciation provides double benefit.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'What is the difference between 80% LTV and 75% LTV cash-out refinancing?'
  faq4Answer = '''LTV (loan-to-value) affects equity access amount and refinancing rates: 80% LTV = Maximum conventional cash-out access (FHA also 80% max, VA 90% max) with standard pricing. Example: $500K home = $400K max loan at 80% LTV. If current mortgage $280K, access $120K cash-out. Rate might be 6.875%. 75% LTV = Lower equity access but better rates (typically 0.125-0.25% lower). Same $500K home = $375K max loan at 75% LTV. Access only $95K cash-out but rate might be 6.625-6.75%. Decision factors: (1) Do you need maximum access or can you use less? (2) Rate savings calculation—0.25% on $375K loan saves $938/year or $4,690 over 5 years. Is sacrificing $25K access worth the rate savings for your needs? (3) Equity buffer—75% LTV maintains stronger equity cushion protecting against value declines. Compare LTV scenarios with specialists at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> who can model rate vs access tradeoffs for your specific refinancing goals.'''
