  faq2Question = "Are Jackson Hole rates higher?"
  faq2Answer = "Jumbo loans (most Jackson Hole properties exceed $766,550) have slightly higher rates than conforming loans. Specialized luxury lenders offer best Jackson pricing."

  faq3Question = "Do rural properties get worse rates?"

  faq4Question = "Should I lock now or wait?"
  faq4Answer = "Lock when you're comfortable with the rate and have a closing timeline. Wyoming's smaller market means less daily rate volatility than major metros."

  faq5Question = "Why does APR matter more than rate?"
