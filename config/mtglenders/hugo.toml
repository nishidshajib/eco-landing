  # FAQ Section
  faqTitle = 'Frequently Asked Questions About Comparing Mortgage Lenders'
  faqSubtitle = 'Common questions about finding and choosing the right mortgage lender'
  
  faq1Question = 'How many mortgage lenders should I compare before choosing?'
  faq1Answer = 'Compare at least 3-5 lenders across different types: a big bank, a credit union, a mortgage broker, and an online lender. Rate differences of 0.25%-0.75% are common between lenders for the same borrower, which translates to $30,000-$90,000 in interest over 30 years. Mortgage brokers simplify this by shopping 20+ wholesale lenders on your behalf in one application, but always compare broker quotes against direct lender quotes too.'
  
  faq2Question = 'Do all lenders see the same credit score I see?'
  faq2Answer = 'No. You might see a 720 VantageScore on Credit Karma, but mortgage lenders use your middle FICO score from Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—often 20-40 points lower than VantageScore. If you have 720/695/680 FICO scores across three bureaus, lenders use 695 (the middle) for pricing and approval. Some lenders also add overlays requiring scores 20-40 points higher than program minimums, so a lender advertising 620 minimum might actually require 660.'
  
  faq3Question = 'What is the difference between a mortgage broker and a mortgage banker?'
  faq3Answer = 'A mortgage banker works for one company (like Wells Fargo or Quicken Loans) and only offers that company loan products and rates. A mortgage broker works with 20-50 wholesale lenders and shops your scenario across all of them to find the best rate and program fit. Brokers typically deliver better rates because they access wholesale pricing that retail banks markup. Brokers get paid by lenders, not borrowers, in most cases.'
  
  faq4Question = 'Why do lenders quote me different rates for the same loan?'
  faq4Answer = 'Lenders have different pricing models, profit margins, operational costs, and risk appetites. A big bank might quote 6.5% with $2,500 in fees because they have high overhead. A credit union quotes 6.25% with $1,000 in fees because they are nonprofits with lower margins. An online lender quotes 6.0% with $0 lender fees because they have minimal operational costs. Rate differences of 0.25%-0.75% are completely normal—which is why comparing multiple lenders saves tens of thousands of dollars.'
  
  faq5Question = 'Can I switch lenders after getting pre-approved?'
  faq5Answer = 'Yes, absolutely. A pre-approval is not binding—it is an estimate of what you could borrow based on initial credit and income review. Many buyers get pre-approved with their bank for credibility with sellers, then shop rates with 3-4 other lenders before submitting an offer. Some borrowers even switch lenders mid-process if they find significantly better rates or service, though this delays closing by 2-4 weeks typically. You are not locked in until you sign final loan documents at closing.'
  
  faq6Question = 'Do credit unions really offer better rates than big banks?'
  faq6Answer = 'Often yes—credit unions are member-owned nonprofits with lower overhead and smaller profit margins, so they typically charge 0.125%-0.5% less than big banks and have lower lender fees ($800-$1,200 versus $2,000-$3,000). However, credit unions may have slower technology, limited loan officer availability, and less flexibility on complex loans like jumbos or non-QM programs. Compare both to see what fits your priorities—sometimes big banks offer relationship discounts for high-net-worth clients that beat credit union pricing.'
