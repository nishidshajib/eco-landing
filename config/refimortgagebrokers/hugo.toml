  faq1Question = 'How do mortgage brokers get better refinance rates than banks?'
  faq1Answer = 'Brokers access wholesale lender pricing that retail banks do not offer directly to consumers. They shop your scenario across 20+ wholesale lenders simultaneously and leverage volume relationships to negotiate pricing concessions. This wholesale channel plus broker competition often delivers 0.125-0.375% better rates or thousands less in fees compared to going direct to one bank.'
  
  faq2Question = 'Do I pay mortgage brokers for refinance rate shopping?'
  faq2Answer = 'Most borrowers pay nothing directly to brokers—lenders pay broker commissions from their own funds, not your money. Brokers must disclose all compensation on your Loan Estimate. In some cases, you can pay broker fees directly to buy down your rate further, but the broker comparison service itself costs you nothing in most refinance transactions.'
  
  faq3Question = 'How long does broker rate shopping take for refinances?'
  faq3Answer = 'Initial rate shopping takes 1-3 business days as brokers submit your scenario to multiple wholesale lenders and collect quotes. Once you select a lender, closing timelines are 30-45 days for most refinances. Brokers often close faster than retail banks because they handle documentation efficiently and have established lender relationships that expedite processing.'
  
  faq4Question = 'Can brokers help with cash-out refinance rate shopping?'
  faq4Answer = 'Yes, brokers specialize in cash-out refinancing and can compare rates across lenders who offer different maximum loan-to-value limits and cash-out amounts. Some lenders allow 80% LTV cash-out while others go to 85-90%. Brokers know which lenders offer best pricing at different LTV levels and can structure your cash-out for optimal rates and fees based on how much equity you need to access.'
