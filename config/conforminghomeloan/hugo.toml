  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What makes a mortgage "conforming"?'
  faq1Answer = '''Conforming loans follow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, stay within FHFA loan limits, and can be sold into agency-backed securities. They offer competitive rates and flexible terms when you meet standard credit, income, and documentation requirements.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'How high can my DTI be?'
  faq2Answer = '''Most conforming loans allow debt-to-income ratios up to 45%, though AUS approvals sometimes stretch to 50% with strong credit, reserves, or large down payments. Understanding compensating factors helps you plan before applying.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'Do I need 20% down for a conforming loan?'
  faq3Answer = '''No. First-time buyers can put as little as 3% down, and repeat buyers can use 5%. However, less than 20% down requires private mortgage insurance (PMI) until you reach 78-80% loan-to-value, at which point you can request removal or it drops automatically.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Can I take cash out with a conforming mortgage?'
  faq4Answer = 'Yes, you can complete a conforming cash-out refinance up to 80% LTV on primary residences (lower for second homes and investment properties). Evaluate total costs, break-even points, and alternative equity products before locking.'
