  faq1Question = "What is the jumbo loan limit in Texas?"
  faq1Answer = "$766,550 for most Texas counties (2025 conforming limit). High-cost counties may have higher limits. Loans above this require jumbo financing."

  faq2Question = "Do I need 20% down for a jumbo loan in Texas?"
  faq2Answer = "Most jumbo lenders require 10%–20% down. Some portfolio lenders offer 10% down jumbo with strong credit (740+) and reserves. Super-jumbo ($2M+) often requires 20%–25% down."

  faq3Question = "What credit score do I need for Texas jumbo loans?"
  faq3Answer = "Minimum 700 for most jumbo lenders; best pricing starts at 740+. Portfolio lenders may approve 680–700 with compensating factors (high reserves, low LTV, strong income)."

  faq4Question = "How many months of reserves do jumbo lenders require?"
  faq4Answer = "6–12 months of PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) in liquid reserves. Higher loan amounts and LTV ratios require more reserves. Portfolio lenders may count retirement accounts with discounting."

  faq5Question = "Can self-employed borrowers get Texas jumbo loans?"
  faq5Answer = "Yes. Portfolio lenders offer bank statement jumbo programs (12–24 months of deposits) and asset-based underwriting for self-employed, business owners, and high-net-worth clients with complex income."

  faq6Question = "What are jumbo mortgage rates in Texas right now?"
  faq6Answer = "Jumbo rates vary widely by lender, credit tier, LTV, and reserves. As of early 2026, expect 6.50%–7.50% for 740+ credit, 20% down. Portfolio lenders and private banks may offer relationship discounts."
