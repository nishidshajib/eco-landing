  faq1Question = "How do I find a good loan officer in Tennessee?"
  faq1Answer = "Search NMLS Registry for licensed Tennessee MLOs, check online reviews, ask for referrals from real estate agents or recent homebuyers. Interview 2-3 loan officers; ask about experience, lender access, specializations, and fees. Licensed MLOs have NMLS number; verify at NMLSConsumerAccess.org."

  faq2Question = "What does a Tennessee loan officer do?"
  faq2Answer = "Tennessee loan officers guide borrowers through mortgage process: pre-approval, credit optimization, rate quotes, loan selection, application, underwriting advocacy, and closing coordination. MLOs have fiduciary duty to recommend suitable loan products and disclose all costs."

  faq3Question = "Do Tennessee loan officers charge fees?"
  faq3Answer = "Compensation varies by lender type. Mortgage brokers typically charge 0.50-1.50% origination fee (paid by borrower or lender). Bank/credit union loan officers often compensated by employer (no direct borrower fee). Compare total loan costs (rate + fees) across multiple officers."

  faq4Question = "How are Tennessee loan officers licensed?"
  faq4Answer = "Tennessee MLOs licensed through NMLS (Nationwide Multistate Licensing System). Requirements: background check, credit check, 20-hour pre-licensing education, national + Tennessee state exam, surety bond. Annual 8-hour continuing education required. License renewal yearly."

  faq5Question = "Can Tennessee loan officers help with credit challenges?"
  faq5Answer = "Yes. Experienced MLOs review credit reports, identify improvement strategies (pay down utilization, dispute errors, authorized user), and advise on timing. Many loan officers recommend 30-90 day credit improvement before application to secure better rates."

  faq6Question = "What's the difference between loan officer and mortgage broker?"
  faq6Answer = "Loan officer works for single lender (bank, credit union, mortgage company); offers that lender's products only. Mortgage broker accesses multiple wholesale lenders (10-50+); compares programs across lenders. Both require NMLS licensing in Tennessee."
