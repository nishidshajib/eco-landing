  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a conforming loan?'
  faq1Answer = '''A conforming loan is a mortgage that meets the standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—including maximum loan limits established annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is $766,550 in most counties, with higher limits in designated high-cost areas. Conforming loans typically offer better rates than non-conforming or jumbo loans.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What are the 2025 conforming loan limits?'
  faq2Answer = '''For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is $766,550 for single-family homes in most counties. High-cost areas can have limits up to $1,149,825. Your specific county limit depends on local housing costs as determined by FHFA. Check with <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> to find your county's exact conforming loan limit.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = '''What's the difference between conforming and non-conforming loans?'''
  faq3Answer = '''Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards (including FHFA loan limits), which allows lenders to sell them to these agencies—resulting in lower rates and easier qualification. Non-conforming loans exceed these limits (jumbo loans) or don't meet underwriting standards, requiring portfolio lending with stricter requirements and typically higher rates.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'How does my credit score affect conforming loan rates?'
  faq4Answer = '''Conforming lenders use your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> to determine rate pricing. Scores of 740+ typically qualify for the best rates, while scores between 620-739 face loan-level price adjustments that increase your interest rate. Understanding your middle score before applying helps you know what rates to expect and whether credit improvement could lower your costs.'''
