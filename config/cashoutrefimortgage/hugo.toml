  faqSubtitle = 'Clear answers about debt payoff through refinancing and strategic equity access'
  
  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'When does cash-out refi make sense for debt consolidation?'
  faq1Answer = '''Cash-out refi makes financial sense for debt consolidation when: (1) High-interest debt (credit cards 18%+, auto loans 7%+) converts to lower mortgage rate (6-7%), (2) You have 20%+ equity (80% LTV conventional), (3) Monthly savings from lower interest exceed increased mortgage payment, (4) Closing costs recover within 18-24 months through debt payoff savings, (5) You plan to stay in home 3+ years. Example: $50K credit card debt at 20% costs $10K/year interest. Cash-out refi at 6.5% costs $3,250/year = $6,750 annual savings. But extending debt into 30-year mortgage requires careful breakeven analysis. Connect with debt consolidation specialists at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> for personalized analysis.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'How much can I save consolidating debt with cash-out refi?'
  faq2Answer = '''Debt consolidation savings through cash-out refi depend on: current debt interest rates, cash-out refi rate (affected by your credit score), debt amount consolidated, and payoff timeline. Example scenarios: (1) $40K credit cards at 22% = $8,800/year interest → cash-out at 6.75% = $2,700/year interest = $6,100 annual savings, (2) $60K mixed debt (cards + auto) at 15% average = $9,000/year interest → cash-out at 6.5% = $3,900/year interest = $5,100 annual savings. However, extending 5-year debt into 30-year mortgage increases total interest paid over full term. Strategic debt consolidation requires breaking even on closing costs ($7K-10K) within 18-24 months through monthly savings, then aggressively paying down mortgage principal. Your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> significantly affects cash-out refi rates and total debt consolidation savings.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'What credit score do I need for cash-out refi debt consolidation?'
  faq3Answer = '''Cash-out refi credit score requirements for debt consolidation: Conventional: 620 minimum (640-679 = standard pricing, 680-719 = better rates, 720+ = optimal rates for maximum debt payoff savings). FHA: 580 minimum (most lenders require 620+, 640+ = better debt consolidation rates). VA: 620-640 typical minimum (700+ = optimal veteran debt consolidation pricing). Your middle credit score (middle of three bureau scores) determines qualification and rate pricing. Credit score impact on debt consolidation: 680 credit = 7.00% cash-out rate, 720 credit = 6.50% cash-out rate on $300K refinance = $91/month difference or $5,460 savings over 5 years. Often worth improving credit 3-6 months before cash-out refi for debt consolidation to optimize rates and maximize debt payoff savings. Calculate your credit tier pricing at <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Cash-Out Refinance®</a> before applying.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Should I do cash-out refi or HELOC for debt consolidation?'
  faq4Answer = '''Cash-out refi vs HELOC for debt consolidation depends on: (1) Current mortgage rate (if you have 3-4% rate, HELOC may preserve low rate better than cash-out refi at 6-7%), (2) Debt amount (large debt $50K+ often favors cash-out refi lower rates, smaller debt $20K-30K may favor HELOC flexibility), (3) Rate environment (fixed cash-out refi vs variable HELOC rates). Example: $60K debt consolidation with 3.75% existing mortgage: Cash-out refi at 6.75% on full $360K balance costs more than HELOC at 9.5% on just $60K—keep low mortgage rate and use HELOC for debt payoff. But if existing mortgage is 5.5%+, cash-out refi at 6.5-7% may offer better overall debt consolidation strategy. Compare both scenarios with loan officers at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> who specialize in debt consolidation analysis.'''
