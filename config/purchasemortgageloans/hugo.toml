  faq1Question = 'Should I choose FHA or conventional for my first home purchase?'
  faq1Answer = '''FHA works best if you have 640-679 credit, limited savings (3.5% down = $10,500 on $300,000), or need gift funds/down payment assistance—but includes permanent mortgage insurance ($200-$300/month). Conventional works best if you have 680+ credit, 5-10% down savings, and can document stable income—PMI is removable at 80% LTV saving $150-$200/month long-term. Check your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> first to see which programs you qualify for, then compare total costs through lenders at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a>.'''
  
  faq2Question = 'How much does credit score affect my purchase loan rate and approval?'
  faq2Answer = '''Purchase mortgage rates vary by 0.25-0.75% across credit tiers on same loan. Example on $300,000 conventional purchase: 640 credit = 7.25% rate ($2,050/month), 680 credit = 6.75% rate ($1,945/month), 740 credit = 6.25% rate ($1,847/month). Over 5 years, improving 640→680 saves $6,300; improving 680→740 saves additional $5,880. FHA is more forgiving below 680 but charges higher mortgage insurance. Understanding your middle score determines which program offers better total cost.'''
  
  faq3Question = 'Can I use gift funds or down payment assistance for my purchase?'
  faq3Answer = '''Yes. FHA allows 100% of down payment from gift funds (parents, family, employers) plus down payment assistance programs offering $5,000-$15,000 grants. Conventional allows gift funds covering entire down payment if you qualify otherwise. Many states offer first-time buyer DPA programs—some buyers purchase with $1,000-$3,000 personal savings. Connect with <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">purchase loan specialists</a> who know local DPA programs and gift fund documentation requirements.'''
  
  faq4Question = 'How long does it take to improve my credit for better purchase loan rates?'
  faq4Answer = '''Most borrowers can improve 20-40 points in 2-4 months through targeted strategies: pay credit cards below 30% utilization (10-30 point boost in 30-60 days), dispute errors on all three bureaus (potential 10-40 point boost in 45-90 days), avoid new credit inquiries (prevents 5-10 point drops), and become authorized user on established account (potential 15-50 point boost in 60-90 days). If you are at 655 credit, waiting 3 months to reach 680 saves $50-$100/month or $3,000-$6,000 over 5 years—making delay financially worthwhile.
