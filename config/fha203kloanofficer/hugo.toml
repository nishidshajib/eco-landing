Limited FHA 203(k) loans cover up to $35,000 in cosmetic repairs (painting, flooring, appliances, minor fixes) with no HUD consultant required, 3.5% down, and 620+ credit. Connect with verified FHA 203(k) loan officers through <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> to compare both programs.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What credit score do I need for an FHA 203(k) loan?'
  faq2Answer = '''Standard FHA 203(k) loans typically require 640+ credit score for 3.5% down (some lenders accept 580-639 with 10% down). Limited FHA 203(k) loans generally need 620+ credit. Your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> determines your rate tier—higher scores (680-720+) qualify for better pricing. Understanding your middle score before applying helps you set realistic expectations and improve eligibility if needed.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'Do I need a HUD consultant for FHA 203(k) loans?'
  faq3Answer = '''Standard FHA 203(k) loans require a HUD consultant to review contractor bids, create renovation work plans, manage draw inspections, and ensure code compliance. Consultant fees typically range $800-$1,500. Limited FHA 203(k) loans (under $35,000 in repairs) do NOT require a HUD consultant—streamlining the process and reducing costs. Your FHA 203(k) loan officer determines which program fits your renovation scope.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Can I use FHA 203(k) if I already own my home?'
  faq4Answer = '''Yes—FHA 203(k) refinance loans let existing homeowners refinance their current mortgage and finance renovations in one loan.
