  faqSubtitle = 'Common questions about buying your first home and mortgage options'
  
  faq1Question = 'What credit score do I need to buy my first home?'
  faq1Answer = 'Minimum credit scores vary by loan type: FHA accepts 580+ for 3.5% down (500-579 with 10% down), conventional requires 620+ for most programs, VA has no official minimum but lenders typically want 620+, and USDA requires 640+ for streamlined approval. Your middle credit score determines qualification, so checking your profile at MiddleCreditScore.com helps you understand which programs fit your situation and what improvements unlock better options.'
  
  faq2Question = 'How much down payment do I need as a first-time buyer?'
  faq2Answer = 'First-time buyers have multiple low-down-payment options: FHA loans require 3.5% down with 580+ credit, conventional 97% LTV programs need just 3% down for qualified first-timers, VA loans offer 0% down for eligible veterans, and USDA loans provide 0% down in eligible rural areas. Down payment assistance programs can further reduce your out-of-pocket costs by providing grants or forgivable loans to stack with these programs.'
  
  faq3Question = 'Should I choose FHA or conventional as a first-time buyer?'
  faq3Answer = 'The choice depends on your credit score, down payment, and how long you plan to keep the loan. FHA works best for 580-640 credit scores, minimal down payments, or need for maximum flexibility. Conventional is often better with 660+ credit, 5%+ down payment, or planning to keep the loan 10+ years due to PMI removal at 20% equity. FHA mortgage insurance stays for loan life with less than 10% down, while conventional PMI drops off once you reach 20% equity—potentially saving tens of thousands long-term.'
  
  faq4Question = 'What is the first-time homebuyer process from start to finish?'
  faq4Answer = 'The typical timeline is 3-6 months: First, check your credit score and improve if needed (0-3 months). Next, save for down payment and closing costs while researching loan options (ongoing). Then get pre-approved with lenders to understand your budget (1-2 weeks). Start house hunting with your realtor within pre-approved price range (1-3 months). Make an offer and negotiate terms once you find the right property (1-2 weeks). Complete home inspection, appraisal, and final underwriting (3-4 weeks). Finally, close on your home and move in. Working with first-time buyer specialists at Browse Lenders accelerates this process by matching you with experienced professionals who understand new buyer challenges.'
