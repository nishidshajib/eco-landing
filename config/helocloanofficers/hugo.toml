  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What is a HELOC and how does it work?'
  faq1Answer = 'A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a revolving credit line secured by your homes equity. Unlike a fixed home equity loan, a HELOC lets you borrow, repay, and borrow again during the draw period (typically 10 years), similar to a credit card. You only pay interest on what you actually use, making it ideal for ongoing expenses like renovations, debt consolidation, or emergency reserves.'
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What is the difference between a HELOC and a cash-out refinance?'
  faq2Answer = 'A HELOC is a second lien that supplements your existing first mortgage, preserving your current rate. A <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> replaces your entire mortgage with a new, larger loan. Choose a HELOC if you want to keep your low first mortgage rate; choose cash-out refinancing if current rates are lower than your existing mortgage or you want to consolidate all debt into one payment.'
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'What credit score do I need to qualify for a HELOC?'
  faq3Answer = 'Most HELOC lenders require a minimum credit score of 620-680, though higher scores (700+) typically unlock better rates and terms. Understanding your <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> is crucial, as lenders use your mid-score among all three bureaus to determine HELOC eligibility, rate pricing, and maximum borrowing limits.'
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Can my employer offer HELOC education as an employee benefit?'
  faq4Answer = 'Yes. Employers can integrate Browse Lenders® HELOC resources into financial wellness programs at no cost to the organization. Employees gain access to educational tools, transparent lender comparisons, and professional HELOC guidance—helping support home equity strategies and long-term financial stability for American homeowners.'
