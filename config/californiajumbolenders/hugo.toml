  faq1Question = "What is the jumbo loan limit in California?"
  faq1Answer = "$1,149,825 for most California counties (2025 high-balance conforming limit). Loans above this require jumbo financing. Some rural counties have lower limits ($766,550)."

  faq2Question = "Do I need 20% down for a jumbo loan in California?"
  faq2Answer = "Most jumbo lenders require 10%–20% down. Some portfolio lenders offer 10% down jumbo with strong credit (740+) and reserves. Super-jumbo ($2M+) often requires 20%–25% down."

  faq3Question = "What credit score do I need for California jumbo loans?"
  faq3Answer = "Minimum 700 for most jumbo lenders; best pricing starts at 740+. Portfolio lenders may approve 680–700 with compensating factors (high reserves, low LTV, strong income)."

  faq4Question = "How many months of reserves do California jumbo lenders require?"
  faq4Answer = "6–12 months of PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) in liquid reserves. California property taxes are high (1%+ of value), so PITI is higher than other states. More reserves help approval."

  faq5Question = "Can tech workers with stock compensation get California jumbo loans?"
  faq5Answer = "Yes. Portfolio lenders offer programs for tech workers with RSUs, stock options, and equity compensation. Vested stock counts as reserves; some lenders count unvested stock at a discount."

  faq6Question = "What are California jumbo mortgage rates right now?"
  faq6Answer = "California jumbo rates vary by lender, credit tier, LTV, and reserves. As of early 2026, expect 6.25%–7.25% for 740+ credit, 20% down. Portfolio lenders and private banks may offer relationship discounts."
