  # FAQ Section
  faqTitle = 'Frequently Asked Questions About FHA Loan Officers'
  faqSubtitle = 'Common questions about working with FHA specialists and government-backed financing'
  
  faq1Question = 'What credit score do I need for an FHA loan?'
  faq1Answer = 'FHA loans accept credit scores as low as 580 for 3.5% down payment loans, and scores as low as 500 with 10% down. However, many lenders impose overlays requiring 600-620 minimum scores. FHA loan officers help you find lenders who work with your specific credit situation and understand compensating factors that can offset lower scores.'
  
  faq2Question = 'How much is FHA mortgage insurance and can it be removed?'
  faq2Answer = 'FHA mortgage insurance includes upfront premium (1.75% of loan amount) and annual premium (0.55-0.85% depending on loan amount and LTV). For loans with less than 10% down, annual MIP remains for the loan life. With 10%+ down, MIP drops after 11 years. Unlike conventional PMI, FHA MIP cannot be removed by reaching 20% equity—requiring refinance to conventional loan for MIP elimination.'
  
  faq3Question = 'Can I use gift funds for my FHA down payment?'
  faq3Answer = 'Yes, FHA allows your entire down payment to come from gift funds provided by family members, employers, close friends with documented interest, or charitable organizations. The donor must provide a gift letter stating the funds are a gift with no repayment obligation, and you must document the transfer through bank statements showing source and deposit.'
  
  faq4Question = 'What is the difference between FHA and conventional loans?'
  faq4Answer = 'FHA loans offer lower credit score requirements (580 vs. 620), smaller down payments (3.5% vs. 3-5%), and more flexible debt-to-income ratios. However, FHA requires both upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums, while conventional loans only require PMI above 80% LTV and allow PMI removal at 20% equity. FHA loan officers help you compare options based on your credit, down payment, and long-term plans to determine which loan type saves more money over your actual holding period.'
