  faqSubtitle = 'Clear answers about working with licensed conventional mortgage brokers'
  
  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'What does a mortgage broker do and how are they different from a lender?'
  faq1Answer = 'A mortgage broker is a licensed professional who works on your behalf to compare loan offers from multiple lenders. Unlike direct lenders who only offer their own products, brokers have access to a wide network of conventional mortgage lenders, allowing them to shop rates, negotiate terms, and match you with the best financing options based on your credit profile and financial goals.'
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'Do I pay the mortgage broker or does the lender pay them?'
  faq2Answer = 'Broker compensation can come from either the lender (lender-paid) or the borrower (borrower-paid), depending on the loan structure. In many cases, lenders pay broker fees, making broker services free to the borrower. When you work with brokers at <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.browselenders.com" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a>, fee structures are disclosed upfront so you understand exactly who pays what before committing.'
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'How do brokers help me get better rates than I could find on my own?'
  faq3Answer = 'Brokers have established relationships with multiple lenders and understand how each lender evaluates <a class="text-accent hover:underline" href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" target="_blank">credit scores</a>, debt-to-income ratios, and loan scenarios. They know which lenders are most competitive for your specific profile and can negotiate pricing, closing costs, and terms on your behalf—often securing better deals than a borrower could negotiate directly.'
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'Can employers offer mortgage broker access as an employee benefit?'
  faq4Answer = 'Yes. Employers can integrate Browse Lenders® broker network access into financial wellness programs at no cost to the organization.
