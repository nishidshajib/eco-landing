  faqSubtitle = 'Clear answers about affordability calculations, budget planning, and financial wellness strategies'
  
  # FAQ 1
  faq1Question = 'How accurate are online mortgage calculators for budget planning?'
  faq1Answer = '''Online mortgage calculators provide accurate estimates based on inputs you provide (loan amount, interest rate, term, property taxes, insurance). They use standard formulas (PITI calculations, amortization schedules, DTI ratios) matching lender calculations. However, final rates depend on your credit score, loan type, and lender-specific fees. Use calculators for planning and comparison, then get personalized quotes from lenders for exact numbers. Our tools incorporate real-world assumptions (1.2% property tax rate, 0.5% insurance, 1% maintenance) providing realistic total cost estimates beyond basic payment calculations.'''
  
  # FAQ 2
  faq2Question = 'What is the 28/36 rule for mortgage affordability?'
  faq2Answer = '''The 28/36 rule is a debt-to-income guideline used by lenders for qualification. 28% rule (front-end DTI): Housing expenses (mortgage, taxes, insurance, HOA) should not exceed 28% of gross monthly income. 36% rule (back-end DTI): Total debt payments (housing + car loans + credit cards + student loans) should not exceed 36% of gross monthly income. Example: $7,000 monthly income × 28% = $1,960 max housing payment, $7,000 × 36% = $2,520 max total debt. Some lenders allow up to 43% back-end DTI for strong credit profiles. Use our DTI calculator to determine your qualification limits.'''
  
  # FAQ 3
  faq3Question = 'Should I choose 15-year or 30-year mortgage for better financial wellness?'
  faq3Answer = '''15-year vs 30-year decision depends on budget flexibility and financial goals. 15-year mortgage: Higher monthly payment ($1,548 more on $400K at 7%), dramatically lower total interest ($319,700 savings), faster equity building, typically 0.5% lower rate, forced savings discipline, limited cash flow flexibility. 30-year mortgage: Lower monthly payment, more cash flow for emergencies/investments/retirement, flexibility to pay extra principal voluntarily, higher total interest cost, slower equity building. Choose 15-year if you have stable income and want forced wealth building. Choose 30-year if you value flexibility or plan to invest payment difference. Use our term comparison calculator to model both scenarios.'''
  
  # FAQ 4
  faq4Question = 'How much should I put down to avoid PMI and optimize budget?'
  faq4Answer = '''PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is required on conventional loans with less than 20% down, typically costing 0.5-1.5% of loan amount annually. Example: $400K home with 10% down ($40K) = $360K loan × 0.8% PMI = $2,880/year = $240/month. PMI drops off automatically at 78% LTV through payments or can be removed at 80% LTV by requesting appraisal. Strategies: (1) 20% down avoids PMI but depletes savings, (2) 10% down with PMI preserves emergency fund, (3) Piggyback loan (80-10-10) avoids PMI with two mortgages. Down payment decision balances PMI costs versus opportunity cost of large down payment and emergency fund preservation. Use our down payment optimizer to compare scenarios.'''
