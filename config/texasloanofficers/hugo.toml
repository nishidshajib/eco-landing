  faqSubtitle = 'Straightforward answers about how loan officers work and how they guide homebuyers.'

  faq1Question = 'What do loan officers charge in Texas?'
  faq1Answer = 'Loan officers are typically employed by lenders and do not charge separate fees. The lender pays the loan officer salary/commission, funded through loan origination fees, interest rates, or processing fees. Never pay a loan officer directly—compensation flows from the lender.'

  faq2Question = 'How do I find a good Texas loan officer?'
  faq2Answer = "Look for loan officers who explain clearly, don't pressure you, and take time to understand your financial goals. Verify licensing through NMLS and the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Read reviews and ask references about their experience."

  faq3Question = 'Should I use a loan officer at a bank or independent?'
  faq3Answer = "Bank loan officers have access only to their bank's products and pricing. Independent loan officers access multiple lenders. Both can be good, but independent officers typically offer wider options. Compare offers from each to see who gives best pricing."

  faq4Question = 'Can loan officers help me with bad credit?'
  faq4Answer = 'Yes, experienced loan officers understand FHA manual underwriting, credit repair strategies, and non-QM lender options. Before formal application, they analyze your credit, recommend improvements, and identify which programs you qualify for despite credit challenges.'

  faq5Question = 'What is rate locking and when should I do it?'
  faq5Answer = "Rate locking protects your interest rate for 30-45 days during underwriting. Loan officers advise locking based on market trends—locking when rates are likely to rise, floating when rates might decrease. The timing decision can save thousands in interest."

  faq6Question = 'Can loan officers help with VA loans?'
  faq6Answer = 'Yes, experienced Texas loan officers understand VA entitlements, funding fees, occupancy requirements, and how to maximize veteran benefits. Many specialize in VA lending and have relationships with VA-focused lenders.'
