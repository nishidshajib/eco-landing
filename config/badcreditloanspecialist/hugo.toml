  learningPara1 = 'Bad credit mortgage approval requires relationships with subprime lenders who accept manual underwriting. Most big banks reject scores below 640 automatically, but specialized lenders review full financial pictures—income stability, rent payment history, down payment size, and reasons for past credit issues matter more than the score alone.'
  learningPara2 = 'Specialists pre-qualify you before lender shopping by analyzing which loan programs fit your profile. FHA works for 580+ scores with limited reserves, while non-QM loans serve recent bankruptcy cases or self-employed borrowers with low tax returns. Portfolio lenders offer the most flexibility but charge higher rates.'
  learningPara3 = 'Timing matters for bad credit approvals. Applying immediately after collections or charge-offs reduces approval odds. Waiting 6-12 months while making on-time payments and disputing errors improves scores by 30-80 points—enough to move from subprime to near-prime rates and save thousands in interest.'

  # FAQ Section
  faqTitle = 'Common Questions About Bad Credit Mortgages'
  
  faq1Question = 'What is the minimum credit score for a mortgage in 2025?'
  faq1Answer = 'FHA allows 500 credit scores with 10% down and manual underwriting, though most FHA lenders require 580 minimum. Conventional loans start at 620. Non-QM and portfolio lenders approve scores as low as 500-550 with compensating factors like large down payments or strong income. Visit MiddleCreditScore.com to see which lenders approve your specific score range.'
  
  faq2Question = 'Can I get a mortgage with collections or charge-offs on my credit?'
  faq2Answer = 'Yes, FHA and many subprime lenders approve mortgages with unpaid collections and charge-offs as long as you meet debt-to-income requirements and show payment history improvements. Some lenders require collection payoff at closing, while others allow them to remain unpaid. Manual underwriting evaluates the circumstances behind collections (medical vs. willful default) when making approval decisions.'
  
  faq3Question = 'How long after bankruptcy can I get a mortgage?'
  faq3Answer = 'FHA requires 2 years after Chapter 7 discharge and 1 year into Chapter 13 repayment (with court approval and on-time payments). Conventional loans require 4 years after Chapter 7 and 2-4 years after Chapter 13. Non-QM lenders approve as soon as 12 months post-discharge with compensating factors like large down payments or strong income. Compare lenders at BrowseLenders.com who specialize in post-bankruptcy approvals.'
  
  faq4Question = 'What is manual underwriting and why does it help bad credit borrowers?'
  faq4Answer = 'Manual underwriting means a human underwriter reviews your full financial picture instead of relying on automated approval systems that instantly reject bad credit. Manual underwriters consider compensating factors—stable income, rent payment history, reasons for credit issues (medical hardship, divorce), down payment size, and recent credit improvements. This allows approval for borrowers automated systems deny.'
  
  faq5Question = 'Should I pay off collections before applying for a mortgage?'
  faq5Answer = 'It depends. Paying old collections (over 2 years) can reset the reporting date and temporarily lower your score. FHA does not require collection payoff unless they affect debt-to-income ratios. Medical collections under $500 are ignored by FHA. Consult with a bad credit specialist before paying collections to avoid unintended score damage. Strategic collection handling is critical for maximizing approval odds.'
  
  faq6Question = 'Can I refinance with bad credit to access equity or lower my rate?'
  faq6Answer = 'Yes, FHA streamline refinancing requires no credit check if you have an existing FHA loan and want to lower your rate. Cash-out refinancing with bad credit is possible through FHA (580+ scores) or non-QM lenders, though rates are higher than prime borrowers pay. If you improved your credit since your original purchase, refinancing can lower your rate even with a score still in the bad credit range. Explore options at Cash-OutRefinance.com.'
