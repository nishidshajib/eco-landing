  faqTitle = "Hawaii Jumbo Lending Questions"
  faqSubtitle = "Common questions about high-cost conforming limits, second-home pricing, and island financing."

  faq1Question = "What is Hawaii's conforming loan limit for jumbo loans?"
  faq1Answer = "Hawaii's high-cost conforming limit is $1,149,825 (2025-2026). Loans above this threshold are jumbo loans requiring specialized underwriting and pricing. This is significantly higher than the $766,550 limit in most states."

  faq2Question = "How much higher are rates for second-home jumbo loans in Hawaii?"
  faq2Answer = "Second-home jumbo loans (common on Maui, Kauai, Big Island) carry 0.50%-0.75% rate premiums compared to primary residence jumbo loans. Portfolio lenders with second-home expertise can minimize these premiums."

  faq3Question = "What credit score is needed for Hawaii jumbo loans?"
  faq3Answer = "Hawaii jumbo lenders prefer 740+ credit scores for best pricing. Second-home jumbo loans often require 720+ minimum. Portfolio lenders may accept 700+ with strong compensating factors (high assets, low DTI, large down payment)."

  faq4Question = "Why do oceanfront properties need specialized jumbo lenders?"
  faq4Answer = "Oceanfront Hawaii properties require specialized appraisers familiar with luxury markets, flood zone verification, and oceanfront valuation expertise. Lenders with appraiser relationships prevent $50K-$200K+ undervaluations and closing delays."

  faq5Question = "Can I structure my loan to stay under the $1.15M conforming limit?"
  faq5Answer = "Yes—increasing down payment to keep loan amount under $1,149,825 enables agency conforming pricing (0.25%-0.50% lower than jumbo). Hawaii jumbo lenders analyze whether larger down payment saves money vs jumbo financing."

  faq6Question = "How do I compare Hawaii jumbo lenders across islands?"
  faq6Answer = "Request Loan Estimates from portfolio lenders, mainland wholesale brokers, and local Hawaii banks. Compare rates, fees, APR, second-home expertise, and island-specific appraisal knowledge for your property type."
