## California HELOC CLTV Limits: What Most Lenders Actually Allow

CLTV (combined loan-to-value) is the biggest limiter on California HELOC size. Even strong credit borrowers can hit caps depending on county and property type.

### Typical CLTV Caps in California
- **Primary residence:** 80%–90%
- **Second home:** 75%–85%
- **Investment property:** 70%–75%

### Why CLTV Matters
CLTV determines how much equity you can actually access. A 5% difference in CLTV can mean $50,000+ on California home values.

### How to Increase Available Equity
1. **Improve credit tier** (lower margin, sometimes higher CLTV).
2. **Reduce balances** on first mortgages before applying.
3. **Compare multiple lenders**—policies vary widely.

### County & Property Effects
Bay Area and coastal counties often have stricter caps than inland markets. Condos can also be capped lower due to HOA risk.

Before you apply, ask the lender for **written CLTV limits** based on your exact property type. That prevents surprises and improves planning.
