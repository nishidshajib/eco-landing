## California HELOC Margins: Why Two Lenders Can Be 0.75% Apart

A HELOC rate is not just Prime. It’s **Prime + margin**, and that margin is where lenders compete. In California, margin differences of **0.25%–0.75%** are common—especially on larger lines or higher CLTVs.

### What Moves the Margin
1. **Credit Tier** – 760+ usually qualifies for the best margin.
2. **CLTV** – Higher combined loan-to-value means higher risk and a wider margin.
3. **Property Type** – Condos and rentals often carry higher margins.
4. **Line Size** – Large lines sometimes qualify for discounts, but not always.

### How to Compare Margins Correctly
- Ask the lender for the **margin in writing**.
- Compare margins across **similar CLTV tiers**.
- Request **life-of-loan caps** and **annual adjustment limits**.

### A Simple California Example
- Lender A: Prime + 0.25%
- Lender B: Prime + 0.75%

On a $100K line, that’s roughly **$500+ per year** difference when Prime is 8.5%.

### Bottom Line
If you only compare the starting rate, you’ll miss the real pricing. Compare **margins and caps** and you’ll make a smarter decision in California’s variable-rate environment.
