## HELOC Draw vs. Repay in California: What Your Payment Will Do

Most California HELOCs start with a **draw period** (interest-only) followed by a **repayment period** (principal + interest). That shift can double your payment if you’re not prepared.

### Typical California HELOC Structure
- **Draw:** 5–10 years (interest-only)
- **Repay:** 10–20 years (fully amortized)

### Why Payments Change So Much
During draw, you only pay interest on what you use. Once repayment begins, the remaining balance is amortized—so the payment jumps.

### How to Plan Before You Open the Line
1. **Model the payment at the repayment phase** using today’s rate plus a cushion.
2. **Consider paying extra during draw** to reduce the balance before repayment.
3. **Ask about fixed-rate conversion options** for stable payments.

### California Tip
If you’re using a HELOC for renovation or consolidation, plan the payoff timeline before the draw ends. That avoids unexpected payment spikes.

A HELOC can be flexible, but only if you understand when and how the payment changes.
