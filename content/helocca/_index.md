California HELOCs are priced by **CLTV limits**, **credit tier**, and **property type**. A Bay Area single-family home can qualify for different margins than a San Diego condo or a Sacramento rental, even with identical credit scores.

HELOCs are usually **variable-rate** and priced as Prime + margin. The margin depends on your equity, score, and lender policy. That’s why comparing multiple lenders is crucial: a 0.50% margin difference can mean thousands in interest over a typical draw period.

Homeowners should pay attention to **draw terms** and **repayment changes**. Payments often jump when the draw period ends, and rate increases can compound quickly. A simple payment model before you open the line helps prevent surprises.

Use HELOC CA to compare lenders, understand CLTV caps, and choose a line that matches your equity strategy.
