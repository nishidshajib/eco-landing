"Refinance when rates drop 1%."

You've probably heard this rule before. It's simple, memorable, and completely oversimplified.

The reality is more nuanced. Sometimes refinancing with a 0.5% rate drop makes perfect sense. Other times, even a 1.5% drop isn't worth the hassle and cost.

Let's talk about when refinancing your conventional loan actually makes financial sense—and when you're better off staying put.

## The Break-Even Point Is Everything

Forget the 1% rule. What really matters is your break-even point: how long it takes to recoup your closing costs through the monthly payment savings.

Here's a simple example:

**Current loan:** $350,000 at 6% = $2,098/month  
**Refinance loan:** $350,000 at 5% = $1,879/month  
**Monthly savings:** $219  
**Closing costs:** $4,500  
**Break-even:** 20.5 months

If you plan to stay in the home for at least two years, the refinance makes sense. But if you're moving in 18 months, you'll lose money.

The math changes dramatically based on your closing costs, loan amount, and rate difference. A smaller loan with high closing costs might need a bigger rate drop to break even. A jumbo loan with low closing costs might break even in under a year with just a 0.5% rate drop.

## Rate-and-Term Refinance vs. Cash-Out

There are two main types of conventional refinances, and they have different goals:

**Rate-and-term refinance:** You're replacing your current loan with a new one at better terms—lower rate, shorter term, or PMI removal. You're not taking cash out. This typically has lower closing costs and better rates.

**Cash-out refinance:** You're borrowing more than you owe and taking the difference in cash. This is how people fund home renovations, pay off high-interest debt, or consolidate bills. Rates are slightly higher, and closing costs reflect the larger loan amount.

If you need cash for a major expense, a [cash-out refinance](https://www.cash-outrefinance.com) can be a smart move—especially if you're also improving your rate or removing PMI in the process. But don't take cash out just because you can. Every dollar you pull out is a dollar you're paying interest on for 15-30 years.

## The PMI Removal Opportunity

This is one of the most overlooked refinance triggers, and it can save you thousands.

Let's say you bought a home two years ago with 5% down. You've been paying PMI of $300/month ($3,600/year). Your home has appreciated, and you now have 25% equity.

You can refinance into a conventional loan without PMI. Even if your interest rate stays the same or goes up slightly, you're still saving $3,600/year by eliminating PMI.

Run the math: if closing costs are $4,000 and you're saving $300/month, you break even in 13 months. After that, it's pure savings.

Many homeowners don't realize you can request PMI removal without refinancing if you've reached 20% equity through appreciation. But if you're close to that mark anyway and rates have improved, refinancing achieves both goals at once.

## Switching from 30-Year to 15-Year

I meet a lot of borrowers in their late 30s or 40s who want to pay off their mortgage before retirement. Refinancing from a 30-year to a 15-year loan can make that happen.

Yes, your monthly payment will be higher—sometimes significantly. But the interest savings are massive.

On a $300,000 loan at 5.5%:  
**30-year loan:** Total interest paid = $312,000  
**15-year loan:** Total interest paid = $134,000  
**Savings:** $178,000

If you can afford the higher payment and you're committed to staying in the home, this is one of the smartest financial moves you can make. You're forced to pay down principal faster, and you're debt-free 15 years sooner.

The catch: make sure that higher payment doesn't squeeze your budget so tight that you can't save for retirement or handle emergencies. Balance is key.

## When Refinancing Is a Bad Idea

Not every rate drop justifies a refinance. Here are situations where you should probably skip it:

**You're planning to move soon.** If you're selling within two years, you won't recoup closing costs. The exception: if you're removing PMI or avoiding an ARM adjustment, it might still make sense.

**Your credit has tanked.** If your credit score has dropped 50+ points since you originally financed, you might not qualify for a better rate—or any rate. Fix your credit first, then refinance later.

**You've already paid down significant principal.** If you're 15 years into a 30-year mortgage, refinancing back to a new 30-year loan resets the clock. You'll pay more interest overall, even if your monthly payment drops. Consider a 15-year or 10-year refi instead.

**Closing costs are astronomical.** Some lenders load up refinances with junk fees. If closing costs exceed 2% of your loan amount, shop around. There's probably a better deal elsewhere.

**Your home value has dropped.** If you're underwater or close to it, you won't qualify for a conventional refinance. You might need to explore HARP-type programs or wait for home values to recover.

## Timing the Market (Or Not)

A lot of borrowers obsess over timing the perfect low point in interest rates. They wait and wait, hoping rates will drop another 0.25%, and then miss the opportunity entirely when rates spike back up.

Here's the truth: you can't time the mortgage market perfectly. If rates are meaningfully better than your current rate (0.75%+ drop) and the break-even makes sense, pull the trigger.

If rates drop again later, you can always refinance again. Yes, you'll pay closing costs twice, but if both refinances produced positive break-even points, you still came out ahead.

The worst strategy is paralysis—sitting on a 7% loan for years waiting for rates to hit 5%, missing the chance to lock in 6% along the way.

## The Streamline Refinance Shortcut

If you already have a conventional loan, you might qualify for a streamlined refinance, which skips some of the underwriting steps and reduces paperwork.

Requirements are still strict (good payment history, sufficient equity), but the process is faster and sometimes cheaper than a full refinance. Ask your current lender if they offer this option.

Just make sure you're still getting a competitive rate. Your current lender isn't always your best option—shop around and compare offers from at least two other lenders to ensure you're not leaving money on the table.

## Credit Score Improvements Change Everything

Here's a refinance trigger most people don't think about: your credit score improved significantly since you bought your home.

Let's say you bought with a 660 credit score and got stuck in a higher rate tier. Two years later, you've paid down debt, fixed errors, and your score is now 750. You could refinance into a much better rate even if market rates haven't changed.

This is especially powerful if you bought during a challenging financial period—maybe you had a bankruptcy or foreclosure that's now further in the past. Once you've rebuilt credit, refinancing can dramatically lower your costs.

## Refinancing to Avoid an ARM Adjustment

If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and your fixed period is ending, refinancing into a fixed-rate conventional loan might be your best move—even if rates are slightly higher than your current rate.

ARMs can adjust significantly, and if you're facing a payment increase of $300-500/month, locking in a fixed rate provides stability and predictability.

Don't wait until the last minute. Start shopping for refinance options 6-9 months before your ARM adjusts so you have time to compare offers and lock in a good rate.

## Your Next Move

Refinancing isn't about following a rule—it's about running your specific numbers and making a decision based on your timeline, goals, and financial situation.

If you're unsure whether refinancing makes sense, talk to a licensed loan officer who can pull your credit, review your current loan terms, and model different scenarios. They can show you exact break-even points and help you decide if now is the right time or if you're better off waiting.
