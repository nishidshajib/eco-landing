Applying in Florida? The fastest approvals come from borrowers who show up file-ready. Loan officers are simply proving you can repay, the property fits the program, and disclosures are met. Here is the short list of what matters, why it matters, and how to get it ready without surprises.

## Income: Prove stability, not perfection

Loan officers want stable, sourced income that comfortably covers your new payment plus existing debts.

**W-2 borrowers**
- Last 30 days of pay stubs
- W-2s (2 years)
- 1040s if you have side income
- Employer verification (simple VOE)

**Self-employed**
- Business and personal returns (2 years)
- Year-to-date P&L
- 3–6 months business bank statements
- Business license or incorporation docs

**Rental income**
- Lease agreements
- Schedule E from tax returns
- Deposits that match leases

**Other income (alimony, child support, benefits)**
- Award or benefit letters
- Proof of receipt (bank statements)

## Assets: Show you can close and still have a cushion

Reserves signal safety. Seasoned funds (sitting 60+ days) are best.

**What to provide**
- Checking and savings (last 2–3 statements)
- Retirement or brokerage (latest statement)
- Gift letter if using family help

**What underwriters scan for**
- Large deposits with clear sources
- Enough to cover down payment, closing costs, and any reserve rule

## Property: Prove what you’re buying and how you’ll use it

**Provide**
- Purchase contract
- Appraisal (lender orders)
- Insurance quote
- Title work and, if requested, survey
- HOA/condo docs when applicable

**Occupancy clarity**
- Primary: intent to occupy
- Second home: when and how often
- Investment: lease or projected rent

## Debts: Set up your DTI early

They’ll pull credit and total monthly obligations to size your maximum payment.

**Be ready with**
- Student and auto loan statements
- Card balances if high
- Alimony/child support docs

## Disclosures: Know the clocks

- Loan Estimate: within 3 days of application
- Closing Disclosure: 3 business days before signing
- APR and finance charges disclosed under TILA

## Quick prep checklist

Before you apply:
- Two years of returns; 30 days of pay stubs (or P&L + bank statements if self-employed)
- 2–3 months of bank and investment statements
- List of monthly debts
- Gift letter ready if using gift funds
- Pull your credit and fix errors

When you meet a loan officer:
- Bring organized copies
- Explain large deposits and job changes
- Ask what else they’ll need for this property type

## Credit still matters
