Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the gatekeeper for how much home you can buy. Florida loan officers use it to decide whether your payment fits. The good news: you can often improve DTI in weeks with the right moves.

## What DTI measures (and the simple math)

DTI is the share of your gross monthly income that goes to monthly debts.

**Formula:** (Total monthly debts ÷ Gross monthly income) × 100

**Example:** $2,450 debts ÷ $7,000 income = 35% DTI

## What counts (and what doesn’t)

**Counts toward DTI**
- Mortgage payment (PITI + HOA if any)
- Car loans/leases
- Student loans (minimum payment)
- Credit card minimums
- Alimony/child support
- Personal loans/HELOCs

**Doesn’t count**
- Utilities, phone, internet
- Groceries and daily spend

## The targets loan officers use

- Conventional: 43% total (can stretch to ~50% with strong factors)
- FHA: about 43% total (sometimes higher with factors)
- VA: ~41% total, flexible with compensating factors
- Jumbo: often 40–43%, tighter overall

## Find your target payment fast

1) Calculate gross monthly income (salary ÷ 12; 24-month average for bonus/commission).
2) Multiply by 0.43 (or your program’s target) to get allowed total debt.
3) Subtract current debts. The remainder is your max PITI+HOA.

Example: $8,000 × 0.43 = $3,440 total; minus $800 debts = ~$2,640 room for housing.

## Quick wins to improve DTI

- Pay down or pay off small loans to drop monthly payments
- Reduce card balances (minimums fall as balances fall)
- Refinance or extend student loans to lower required payment
- Pause big purchases (car) until after closing

## 30-day action plan

Week 1: List debts and minimums; target 1–2 small balances to eliminate.

Week 2: Move cash to pay cards below 30% utilization; request higher limits (no hard pull) to reduce reported minimums.

Week 3: If student loans are heavy, price a refinance or extended term to lower the required payment.

Week 4: Avoid new credit pulls; keep spending flat so reported balances stay low when the lender pulls credit.

## DTI vs. credit score

Credit score sets your pricing tier; DTI sets how much you can borrow. You need both: strong score for better pricing, solid DTI for approval amount.

## Ask your loan officer

- What’s my current back-end DTI?
- If I pay off one debt, which gives the biggest boost?
- What’s the max housing payment I should target today?
- Are there compensating factors to stretch my DTI?

## Bring to the conversation

- Recent pay stubs and returns
- Full debt list with minimums
- Card balances and limits
- Notes on any income changes
