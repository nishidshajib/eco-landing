Buying your first home in Florida is a significant financial decision. Understanding documentation requirements, credit expectations, down payment options, and how loan officers evaluate your application helps you approach the process with confidence and avoid surprises.

## Understanding Down Payment Requirements for First-Time Buyers

**Minimum Down Payments by Program:**

**Conventional Loans:**
- 3% down (with mortgage insurance)
- 5% down (less mortgage insurance)
- 10-20% down (minimal or no mortgage insurance)

**FHA Loans (Popular for First-Time Buyers):**
- 3.5% down (if credit score 580+)
- 10% down (if credit score below 580)

**VA Loans (Military Members):**
- 0% down (no down payment required)
- 2.3% VA funding fee (typically rolled into loan)

**USDA Loans (Certain Rural Areas):**
- 0% down (income limits apply)

## Down Payment Sources

**Acceptable Down Payment Sources:**
- Personal savings (most common)
- Gifts from family members (requires gift letter)
- Down payment assistance programs (Florida has several)
- Employer relocation assistance
- Non-taxable retirement account withdrawals (in some cases)

**Not Acceptable:**
- Borrowed funds or personal loans
- Credit card cash advances
- Unsecured loans

## Documentation First-Time Buyers Must Provide

**Income Documentation:**
- W-2 statements (past 2 years)
- Recent pay stubs (last 30 days)
- Tax returns with all schedules (past 2 years)
- Written employment verification from employer
- Explanation letter if you changed jobs within past 2 years

**Asset Documentation:**
- Bank statements (last 2-3 months) for down payment source
- Investment account statements
- Retirement account statements (401k, IRA)
- Gift letter if down payment includes family gift
- Proof of source of large deposits

**Credit and Debt Information:**
- Authorization for credit report pull
- Explanation letters for any negative marks (late payments, collections)
- Documentation of paid collections or disputed items
- List of all current debts and monthly obligations

**Property and Purchase Information:**
- Signed purchase agreement
- Real estate agent contact information
- Identification (driver's license or passport)
- Property address and description

## Credit Score Requirements for First-Time Buyers

**Conventional Loans:**
- Minimum 620 middle credit score (some programs require 640)
- Better rates typically start at 680+

**FHA Loans:**
- Minimum 580 middle credit score (3.5% down)
- Minimum 640 middle credit score recommended (10% down, but wider rate options)

**VA Loans:**
- No official minimum (lenders set their own, typically 620+)
- Often more lenient on credit issues if compensating factors exist

**What "Middle Credit Score" Means:**
Your lender uses the median score from three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion), not the highest or lowest. Understanding your middle score before applying lets you know what rates you'll likely qualify for.

## Debt-to-Income Ratio Limits

Lenders verify that your new mortgage payment doesn't exceed 43-50% of your gross monthly income.

**Calculation:**
(All monthly debts ÷ Gross monthly income) × 100 = DTI

**Example:**
- Gross monthly income: $6,000
- Estimated mortgage payment: $1,500
- Auto loan: $300
- Student loans: $250
- Credit cards: $200
- Total debts: $2,250
- DTI: 37.5% ($2,250 ÷ $6,000)

High student loan balances or credit card debt can limit your borrowing power even with good credit and income.

## Mortgage Insurance for First-Time Buyers

**Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) - Conventional Loans:**
- Required if down payment is less than 20%
- Typical cost: 0.5-1% of loan amount annually
- Can be removed once you reach 20% equity

**FHA Mortgage Insurance:**
- Upfront insurance: 1.75% of loan amount (rolled into loan)
- Annual insurance: 0.5-0.8% depending on down payment percentage
- Cannot be removed (permanent for loans with 10% down or less)

**VA Funding Fee (VA Loans):**
- One-time charge: 1.4-2.3% of loan amount
- Varies based on down payment percentage
- Waived for 0% disability rating

## Closing Costs You'll Pay

**Typical Closing Costs (2-5% of loan amount):**
- Loan origination fee: 0.5-1%
- Appraisal: $300-600
- Title search and insurance: $200-600
- Attorney fees (FL requires): $300-600
- Homeowners insurance: depends on property
- Property taxes: depends on county
- Recording fees: $50-200

## How to Choose a Florida Loan Officer

**Prepare Questions:**
