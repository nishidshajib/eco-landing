When I started house hunting as a first-time buyer, everyone told me about FHA loans with 3.5% down. What nobody mentioned were the dozens of other programs offering grants, down payment assistance, and better loan terms than FHA—without the lifetime mortgage insurance penalty.

I discovered one of these programs completely by accident when a loan officer casually mentioned "HomeReady" in passing. That single conversation saved me over $40,000 in mortgage insurance costs over the life of my loan compared to FHA.

Here are the first-time buyer programs that most people never hear about—but could save you thousands or make homeownership possible years earlier than you thought.

## Why Most People Only Know About FHA Loans

FHA loans get all the attention because they're easy to explain: 3.5% down, 580 credit score minimum, flexible debt-to-income ratios. But here's what the headlines don't tell you:

- **FHA mortgage insurance never goes away** (on loans after 2013 with less than 10% down)
- **FHA insurance is expensive** (1.75% upfront + 0.55-0.85% annually)
- **FHA appraisals are stricter** and can kill deals over minor property issues

For many first-time buyers, conventional programs with 3% down offer better long-term value—especially if you have decent credit and stable income.

## Fannie Mae HomeReady: The Program Lenders Don't Always Mention

HomeReady is designed specifically for low-to-moderate income buyers, but the qualification requirements are much more flexible than most people realize.

### HomeReady Key Features
- **3% down payment** (as low as 3% from your own funds)
- **620 minimum credit score** (lower than most conventional programs)
- **Flexible income sources:** Boarder income, rental income from multi-unit properties, non-borrower household income all count
- **Income limits apply:** Varies by county, generally 80-100% of area median income
- **Lower PMI costs** than standard conventional loans
- **PMI cancels at 20% equity** (unlike FHA's lifetime MIP)

### Real-Life Example
When I bought my first home in 2019, I qualified for HomeReady because:
- My income was $62,000 (below the $68,000 limit in my county)
- I had a 680 credit score
- I put 3% down ($9,000 on a $300,000 home)

My PMI was $142/month with HomeReady vs $186/month with standard conventional—a $44/month savings that added up to $3,960 over the seven years before I removed PMI through appreciation and principal paydown.

If I'd gone FHA instead, I'd be paying $205/month in mortgage insurance **forever** (unless I refinanced). That's $2,460 per year—every year—for the entire 30-year loan.

### Who Should Consider HomeReady?
- **First-time buyers** in moderate-cost areas
- **Buyers with 620-739 credit scores** who don't qualify for best pricing
- **Multi-unit property buyers** who can use rental income to qualify
- **Buyers with non-traditional income sources** (freelancers, side hustles, boarders)

## Freddie Mac Home Possible: HomeReady's Cousin

Home Possible is Freddie Mac's version of HomeReady with similar benefits but slightly different requirements.

### Home Possible Key Features
- **3% down payment** (as low as 3% from your own funds)
- **660 minimum credit score** (slightly higher than HomeReady)
- **Income limits:** Generally 80% of area median income
- **Flexible income sources:** Non-borrower household income counts
- **Lower PMI costs** than standard conventional loans
- **PMI cancels at 20% equity**

### HomeReady vs Home Possible: Which Is Better?

**Choose HomeReady if:**
- Your credit score is 620-659 (HomeReady allows lower scores)
- You need more flexible income documentation
- Your lender offers better HomeReady pricing

**Choose Home Possible if:**
- Your credit score is 660+ (Home Possible often has better pricing for higher scores)
- Your lender has better Freddie Mac relationships
- You're buying a multi-unit property (Home Possible is more flexible with rental income)

Both programs are excellent alternatives to FHA for first-time buyers who meet income limits.

## State and Local Down Payment Assistance Programs (The Hidden Gold Mine)

This is where first-time buyers can find serious money—but you have to know where to look.

### How State Programs Work
Most states offer first-time buyer programs with:
- **Down payment grants:** $3,000-$15,000 in free money (doesn't have to be repaid)
- **Down payment loans:** 0% interest loans forgiven after 5-10 years
- **Reduced interest rates:** 0.5-1.0% below market rates
- **Closing cost assistance:** Additional grants to cover fees

### Real-Life State Program Examples

**California: CalHFA MyHome Assistance Program**
- **Assistance amount:** 3.5% of purchase price (up to $15,000)
- **Eligibility:** First-time buyers with income limits
- **Loan types:** Can combine with FHA, VA, USDA, or conventional
- **Repayment:** Deferred loan forgiven after staying in home 30 years

**Texas: Texas State Affordable Housing Corporation (TSAHC)**
- **Assistance amount:** $15,000-$40,000 depending on program
- **Eligibility:** First-time buyers meeting income/credit requirements
- **Loan types:** Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA
- **Repayment:** Some programs are grants, others are forgivable loans

**Illinois: Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA)**
- **Assistance amount:** $10,000 grant
- **Eligibility:** First-time buyers in target areas
- **Loan types:** Conventional or FHA
- **Repayment:** Grant (no repayment required)

**Florida: Florida Housing Finance Corporation**
- **Assistance amount:** Up to 5% of purchase price
- **Eligibility:** First-time buyers with income limits
- **Loan types:** Can layer with FHA or conventional
- **Repayment:** Second mortgage forgiven over time

**Ohio: Ohio Housing Finance Agency**
- **Assistance amount:** $7,500-$20,000
- **Eligibility:** First-time buyers and repeat buyers in target areas
- **Loan types:** Works with conventional, FHA, VA
- **Repayment:** Forgivable loan after 15 years

### How to Find Your State's Programs

1. **Google "[Your State] housing finance agency"**
2. **Visit your state's HFA website** and look for first-time buyer programs
3. **Contact approved lenders** who participate in state programs (not all lenders do)
4. **Check income and purchase price limits** for your county

Most state programs have income limits (typically 80-120% of area median income) and purchase price limits (usually aligned with conforming loan limits). But if you qualify, you can stack these programs with low down payment loans for minimal out-of-pocket costs.

## Local City and County Programs (Even More Money)

Beyond state programs, many cities and counties offer additional down payment assistance—and you can often stack local + state + federal programs together.

### Examples of Local Programs

**Chicago: City of Chicago ARO Program**
- **Assistance:** $40,000-$100,000 forgivable loan
- **Eligibility:** Income limits apply
- **Requirement:** Must live in home 10 years for full forgiveness

**Portland: Portland Housing Bureau Programs**
- **Assistance:** Up to $80,000 in down payment help
- **Eligibility:** Income limits and first-time buyer status
- **Requirement:** Varies by program

**Philadelphia: Philly First Home**
- **Assistance:** Up to $10,000 grant
- **Eligibility:** First-time buyers in Philadelphia
- **Requirement:** Homebuyer education course

### How to Find Local Programs
- **Google "[Your City] first-time home buyer assistance"**
- **Contact your city's housing department**
- **Ask local lenders** who work in your area regularly
- **Visit HUD's local office directory**

Local programs often have shorter waitlists and less competition than state programs—but fewer people know about them.

## Conventional 97: The 3% Down Program Nobody Talks About

Conventional 97 is a standard Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac program that allows 3% down—but unlike HomeReady and Home Possible, it has **no income limits**.

### Conventional 97 Key Features
- **3% down payment**
- **620 minimum credit score**
- **No income limits** (great for higher earners who don't qualify for HomeReady/Home Possible)
- **PMI required until 20% equity**
- **Available from most lenders**

### When to Use Conventional 97
- You make too much money to qualify for HomeReady/Home Possible
- You have good credit (680+) and want to avoid FHA
- You want PMI that cancels automatically at 20% equity

If your income exceeds the limits for income-restricted programs, Conventional 97 is your best 3% down option.

## How Your Credit Score Affects Program Eligibility

Your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> determines which programs you qualify for and what interest rates you'll receive.

### Program Minimums by Credit Score
- **580-619:** FHA only (3.5% down)
- **620-659:** HomeReady, FHA, VA, USDA
- **660-679:** Home Possible, Conventional 97, FHA
- **680-739:** All programs with competitive pricing
- **740+:** Best pricing on all programs

If your score is borderline (620-679), improving it by 20-40 points before applying can unlock better programs and save thousands in interest and PMI costs.

## Teacher, Police, and Public Service Programs

If you work in public service, you may qualify for special programs with even better terms.

### Good Neighbor Next Door (HUD)
- **For:** Law enforcement, teachers, firefighters, EMTs
- **Benefit:** 50% discount on HUD-owned homes in revitalization areas
- **Requirement:** Must live in home 3 years
- **Down payment:** $100 (yes, really)

### Teacher Next Door
- **For:** Full-time teachers
- **Benefit:** Down payment assistance grants up to $7,500
- **Requirement:** Varies by program and state
- **Loan types:** Works with FHA, VA, conventional

### Police Officer Programs
Many cities offer discounted homes or down payment assistance for officers who agree to live in high-priority neighborhoods. Check with your city's police recruitment office.

## Military and Veteran Programs: VA Loans

If you're active military or a veteran, VA loans are hands-down the best program available:

### VA Loan Benefits
- **$0 down payment** (no down payment required)
- **No PMI** (ever)
- **Competitive rates** (often 0.25-0.50% lower than conventional)
- **Flexible credit requirements** (many lenders accept 580+ scores)
- **Funding fee:** 2.15-3.30% (can be rolled into loan, waived for disabled veterans)

VA loans beat every other program for eligible borrowers. If you qualify for VA, use it.

## USDA Loans: $0 Down in Rural and Suburban Areas

USDA loans get overlooked because people assume "rural" means farms and fields. But USDA eligibility covers **97% of U.S. land area**—including suburbs of major cities.

### USDA Loan Benefits
- **$0 down payment**
- **No PMI** (1.0% upfront fee + 0.35% annual fee instead)
- **Competitive rates**
- **Flexible credit requirements** (640+ recommended)

### USDA Eligibility
- **Location:** Property must be in USDA-eligible area (check USDA map online)
- **Income limits:** Typically 115% of area median income
- **Property type:** Primary residence only (no investment properties)

If you're buying in a suburb or small town, check USDA eligibility before assuming you don't qualify. You might be surprised.

## How to Actually Get These Programs (Most Lenders Don't Offer Them)

Here's the frustrating reality: **not all lenders participate in these programs**, and many loan officers don't mention them unless you ask specifically.

### How to Find Lenders Who Offer These Programs

1. **Search your state HFA's approved lender list** (state programs)
2. **Ask lenders directly:** "Do you offer HomeReady, Home Possible, and state down payment assistance programs?"
3. **Use lender-matching services** like <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> that specialize in first-time buyer programs
4. **Work with local credit unions and community banks** (often more flexible than big banks)

Don't assume the first lender you contact knows about or offers these programs. Shop around and ask specifically.

## Can You Stack Programs? (Yes, and You Should)

One of the best-kept secrets: **you can often combine multiple programs together** to minimize out-of-pocket costs.

### Real-Life Stacking Example
**Scenario:** First-time buyer in Illinois purchasing a $250,000 home

**Program Stack:**
1. **Fannie Mae HomeReady:** 3% down ($7,500)
2. **Illinois IHDA Grant:** $10,000 down payment assistance
3. **Local county program:** $5,000 closing cost assistance

**Total out-of-pocket:** $0 (assistance covers down payment and closing costs)

**Result:** Buy a home with no money down, conventional financing, and PMI that cancels at 20% equity—better than FHA in every way.

### How to Stack Programs
1. **Start with your base loan:** HomeReady, Home Possible, Conventional 97, FHA
2. **Add state assistance:** Check your state HFA for down payment grants/loans
3. **Add local assistance:** Check city/county programs
4. **Work with experienced lenders:** Not all lenders know how to layer programs correctly

The key is finding a lender who regularly works with these programs and knows how to combine them legally and effectively.

## Common First-Time Buyer Program Myths (Debunked)

### Myth 1: "You need perfect credit for conventional 3% down programs"
**Reality:** HomeReady accepts 620+ scores, and many buyers with 640-680 scores qualify with competitive rates.

### Myth 2: "FHA is always the best option for first-time buyers"
**Reality:** FHA has lifetime mortgage insurance that never cancels (with less than 10% down). Conventional 3% down programs cancel PMI at 20% equity, saving tens of thousands long-term.

### Myth 3: "Down payment assistance is only for very low-income buyers"
**Reality:** Many programs have income limits at 80-120% of area median income—covering middle-class buyers making $60,000-$120,000+ depending on location.

### Myth 4: "State programs have years-long waitlists"
**Reality:** Some programs do have waitlists, but many are first-come, first-served or have quick turnaround times. Apply early and ask about timelines.

## How to Get Started with First-Time Buyer Programs

### Step 1: Check Your Credit Score
Pull your free credit reports and check your scores. If you're below 640, focus on improving your score before applying.

Visit <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Middle Credit Score</a> to understand how your credit affects your mortgage options and what scores you need for each program.

### Step 2: Research Your State and Local Programs
- Google "[Your State] housing finance agency"
- Google "[Your City] first-time home buyer assistance"
- Make a list of programs you potentially qualify for

### Step 3: Contact Multiple Lenders
Don't just call one bank. Contact 3-5 lenders and ask:
- "Do you offer Fannie Mae HomeReady and Freddie Mac Home Possible?"
- "What state and local down payment assistance programs do you work with?"
- "Can you help me stack multiple programs together?"

### Step 4: Get Pre-Approved with the Best Program
Once you find a lender who offers the programs you qualify for, get pre-approved so you know your budget and can move quickly when you find the right home.

### Step 5: Take Required Homebuyer Education
Many state and local programs require homebuyer education courses (usually 6-8 hours online). Complete this early so you're ready when you apply.

## Final Thoughts: Don't Leave Money on the Table

The biggest mistake first-time buyers make is assuming FHA is their only option—or that they need 20% down to buy a home.

The truth is there are **dozens of programs** offering:
- **3% down conventional loans** with cancellable PMI
- **$0 down VA and USDA loans** with no mortgage insurance
- **State and local grants** worth $5,000-$40,000+ in free money
- **Special programs for teachers, police, and public service workers**

But you have to know these programs exist and find lenders who actually offer them.

Start by researching your state's housing finance agency, checking your credit score at <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Middle Credit Score</a>, and connecting with lenders through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> who specialize in first-time buyer programs.

The program that saves you tens of thousands of dollars might be one conversation away—but only if you ask about it.
