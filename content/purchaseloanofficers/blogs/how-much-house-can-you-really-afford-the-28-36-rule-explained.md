When I got pre-approved for a mortgage, my lender told me I qualified for a $450,000 home. I was thrilled—until I sat down with a spreadsheet and realized that buying a $450,000 home would leave me with $300 per month for groceries, gas, and everything else after paying my mortgage, car loan, student loans, and utilities.

I was approved for way more house than I could comfortably afford.

This is where the **28/36 rule** comes in—a simple guideline that helps you figure out what you can actually afford based on your income and debts, not just what a lender will approve you for.

Here's how the 28/36 rule works, why lenders sometimes approve you for too much house, and how to calculate your true affordability so you don't end up house-poor.

## What Is the 28/36 Rule?

The 28/36 rule is a debt-to-income (DTI) guideline used by lenders to determine how much house you can afford. It consists of two limits:

### The 28% Rule (Front-End Ratio)
Your **total housing expenses** should not exceed **28% of your gross monthly income**.

**Housing expenses include:**
- Principal and interest (P&I)
- Property taxes
- Homeowners insurance
- HOA fees (if applicable)
- PMI (if putting less than 20% down)

This is called your **front-end ratio** or **housing ratio**.

### The 36% Rule (Back-End Ratio)
Your **total monthly debt payments** (including housing expenses) should not exceed **36% of your gross monthly income**.

**Total debts include:**
- Housing expenses (P&I, taxes, insurance, HOA, PMI)
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Credit card minimum payments
- Personal loans
- Child support/alimony

This is called your **back-end ratio** or **debt-to-income ratio (DTI)**.

## How the 28/36 Rule Works: Real-Life Example

Let's say you make **$80,000 per year** ($6,667 per month gross income).

### Front-End Ratio (28%)
**28% of $6,667 = $1,867 maximum monthly housing payment**

This includes:
- Principal and interest: $1,400
- Property taxes: $250
- Homeowners insurance: $150
- PMI: $67

**Total: $1,867** ✅ Meets the 28% rule.

### Back-End Ratio (36%)
**36% of $6,667 = $2,400 maximum total debt payments**

This includes:
- Housing expenses: $1,867
- Car loan: $350
- Student loans: $150
- Credit cards: $33

**Total: $2,400** ✅ Meets the 36% rule.

If your car loan were $600/month instead of $350, your total debts would be $2,650—exceeding the 36% limit. You'd need to either:
- Pay off some debt before applying for a mortgage
- Lower your housing budget
- Increase your income

## Why Lenders Approve More Than the 28/36 Rule Allows

Here's the dirty secret: **lenders don't actually follow the 28/36 rule anymore**—at least not strictly.

Most conventional loan programs allow:
- **Front-end ratio up to 33-38%** (higher than 28%)
- **Back-end ratio up to 43-50%** (higher than 36%)

FHA loans allow even more:
- **Front-end ratio up to 31-40%**
- **Back-end ratio up to 43-57%** (with compensating factors)

### Why Do Lenders Allow Higher Ratios?

1. **Mortgage insurance and automation:** Lenders use automated underwriting systems that approve higher DTIs if you have strong credit, large down payments, or cash reserves.

2. **Compensating factors:** High income, significant savings, or low debt elsewhere can justify higher housing payments.

3. **Lenders make more money:** The bigger your loan, the more interest and fees the lender earns.

### Real-Life Example: My Pre-Approval vs My Comfort Zone

**My income:** $90,000/year ($7,500/month gross)

**What the lender approved me for:**
- **Front-end ratio:** 38% ($2,850/month housing)
- **Back-end ratio:** 48% ($3,600/month total debts)
- **Loan amount:** $450,000 home purchase

**What I could comfortably afford based on 28/36:**
- **Front-end ratio:** 28% ($2,100/month housing)
- **Back-end ratio:** 36% ($2,700/month total debts)
- **Loan amount:** $330,000 home purchase

The lender approved me for a home **$120,000 more expensive** than what I could comfortably afford. If I'd bought at the top of my pre-approval, I would have been house-poor—struggling to save, travel, or handle unexpected expenses.

## How to Calculate Your Affordable Home Price Using 28/36

Let's walk through the calculation step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Gross Monthly Income
Add up your total annual income (before taxes) and divide by 12.

**Example:**
- **Annual salary:** $80,000
- **Gross monthly income:** $80,000 ÷ 12 = $6,667

Include all stable income sources:
- Base salary
- Bonuses (if consistent)
- Commissions (average over 2 years)
- Rental income (75% of gross rents)
- Side income (if documented over 2 years)

### Step 2: Calculate Your Maximum Housing Payment (28% Rule)
Multiply your gross monthly income by 28%.

**Example:**
- **$6,667 × 0.28 = $1,867 maximum housing payment**

### Step 3: Calculate Your Maximum Total Debt Payments (36% Rule)
Multiply your gross monthly income by 36%.

**Example:**
- **$6,667 × 0.36 = $2,400 maximum total debt payments**

### Step 4: Subtract Existing Debts to Find Your Housing Budget
Subtract your current monthly debt payments from your maximum total debt payments.

**Example:**
- **Maximum total debts:** $2,400
- **Existing debts:** $533 (car $350, student loans $150, credit card $33)
- **Available for housing:** $2,400 - $533 = **$1,867**

If this number is **lower than your front-end ratio limit** ($1,867 in this example), your existing debts are restricting your budget. You'd need to pay off debts to increase your housing budget.

### Step 5: Subtract Property Taxes, Insurance, and HOA to Find P&I Budget
Estimate monthly property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA fees, and PMI (if applicable), then subtract from your housing budget.

**Example:**
- **Maximum housing payment:** $1,867
- **Property taxes:** $250/month (estimate: 1.2% annual property tax ÷ 12)
- **Homeowners insurance:** $150/month
- **PMI:** $67/month (if putting less than 20% down)
- **HOA fees:** $0
- **Available for P&I:** $1,867 - $250 - $150 - $67 = **$1,400**

### Step 6: Convert P&I to Home Price
Use a mortgage calculator to determine what home price you can afford with your P&I budget, down payment, and current interest rates.

**Example:**
- **P&I budget:** $1,400/month
- **Interest rate:** 6.75%
- **Down payment:** 5% ($20,000)
- **Loan amount:** ~$265,000
- **Home price:** $265,000 ÷ 0.95 = **$279,000**

So with $80,000 income, $533 in existing debts, and a 5% down payment, you can afford a home around **$279,000** using the 28/36 rule.

## Front-End Ratio vs Back-End Ratio: Which Matters More?

Both ratios matter, but **back-end ratio (total DTI) is usually the limiting factor** for most buyers.

### When Front-End Ratio Limits You
If you have **low or no debt**, your front-end ratio (28%) will be your constraint.

**Example:**
- **Income:** $6,667/month
- **Front-end limit:** $1,867 (28%)
- **Back-end limit:** $2,400 (36%)
- **Existing debts:** $100/month
- **Limiting factor:** Front-end ratio (you can't use the full $2,400 because housing alone can't exceed $1,867)

### When Back-End Ratio Limits You
If you have **significant debt** (car loans, student loans, credit cards), your back-end ratio (36%) will be your constraint.

**Example:**
- **Income:** $6,667/month
- **Front-end limit:** $1,867 (28%)
- **Back-end limit:** $2,400 (36%)
- **Existing debts:** $800/month
- **Available for housing:** $2,400 - $800 = $1,600
- **Limiting factor:** Back-end ratio (your housing budget is capped at $1,600 instead of $1,867 because of existing debts)

**Takeaway:** If your back-end ratio limits you, **pay off debt before buying** to increase your housing budget.

## How Debt-to-Income (DTI) Limits Vary by Loan Type

Different loan programs have different DTI limits, which affects how much you can borrow.

### Conventional Loans
- **Maximum front-end ratio:** 28-38% (with strong credit/reserves)
- **Maximum back-end ratio:** 36-50% (with automated approval)

**Typical limit:** 43% back-end DTI for most borrowers.

### FHA Loans
- **Maximum front-end ratio:** 31-40%
- **Maximum back-end ratio:** 43-57% (with compensating factors like high credit score or cash reserves)

**Typical limit:** 43-50% back-end DTI.

### VA Loans
- **No official front-end ratio limit**
- **Maximum back-end ratio:** 41% (can go higher with residual income test)

VA loans use a **residual income calculation** instead of strict DTI—meaning they look at how much money you have left after all debts, which is often more flexible.

### USDA Loans
- **Maximum front-end ratio:** 29%
- **Maximum back-end ratio:** 41%

USDA loans are stricter than conventional or FHA.

## What Happens If You Ignore the 28/36 Rule?

I know people who bought homes at the top of their pre-approval (48-50% DTI) and deeply regretted it. Here's what happens when you're house-poor:

### Financial Stress
- **No emergency fund:** One unexpected car repair or medical bill becomes a crisis.
- **No savings:** You can't save for retirement, vacations, or future goals.
- **Constant anxiety:** Every paycheck goes to bills with nothing left over.

### Lifestyle Sacrifices
- **No dining out, no travel, no hobbies:** All discretionary spending disappears.
- **Delayed maintenance:** You can't afford to fix things when they break, leading to bigger problems later.
- **Relationship stress:** Money fights become constant.

### Inability to Handle Rate Increases or Income Changes
If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and rates rise, or if you lose your job, you're immediately at risk of foreclosure because you have no financial cushion.

**Real-life story:** My friend bought a $550,000 home on a $110,000 salary (50% DTI). Two years later, his furnace died ($6,000 replacement), his roof started leaking ($8,000 repair), and he had to put both on credit cards because he had no savings. He's now carrying $14,000 in high-interest debt and regrets buying such an expensive home.

## How to Find Your True Comfort Zone (Beyond 28/36)

The 28/36 rule is a good starting point, but your personal comfort zone might be different.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

**1. How stable is your income?**
If you're a freelancer, commissioned salesperson, or work in a volatile industry, you might want a lower DTI (25/33 or lower) to handle income fluctuations.

**2. How much do you value financial flexibility?**
If you prioritize travel, hobbies, and experiences, keep your housing payment under 25% so you have cash for those things.

**3. How risk-averse are you?**
If you sleep better with a financial cushion, aim for 20-25% front-end ratio instead of 28%.

**4. Do you expect income growth?**
If you're early in your career and expect raises, you might be comfortable with 30-33% knowing your income will increase.

**5. How much do you have in reserves?**
If you have 12+ months of expenses saved, you can comfortably handle a higher DTI. If you have minimal savings, stick to lower DTI to avoid financial stress.

### My Personal Comfort Zone

My lender approved me for 48% DTI, but I chose a home that kept me at **32% DTI**. This gave me:
- **Emergency fund:** 6 months of expenses saved
- **Retirement savings:** 15% of income going to 401(k)
- **Travel budget:** $4,000/year for vacations
- **Peace of mind:** I don't stress about money

Buying less house than I was approved for was the best financial decision I've made.

## How to Improve Your Affordability

If the 28/36 rule shows you can't afford the home you want, here are strategies to increase your budget:

### 1. Pay Off Debt
Every $100/month in debt you eliminate frees up $100/month for housing.

**Example:**
- **Current DTI:** 40% ($800 in debts)
- **Pay off car loan:** -$400/month debt
- **New DTI:** 34% ($400 in debts)
- **New housing budget:** +$400/month

### 2. Increase Your Income
Raises, side hustles, or additional income sources increase your gross income and expand your ratios.

**Example:**
- **Current income:** $6,667/month → 28% = $1,867 housing budget
- **New income (raise + side hustle):** $7,500/month → 28% = $2,100 housing budget
- **Increase:** +$233/month housing budget

### 3. Improve Your Credit Score
Higher credit scores unlock better interest rates, which lowers your monthly P&I payment and stretches your budget.

Check your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> and work on improving it before applying for a mortgage to maximize your affordability.

### 4. Save a Larger Down Payment
Larger down payments reduce your loan amount, lower your monthly payment, and eliminate PMI (if you hit 20% down).

**Example:**
- **5% down on $300,000 home:** $285,000 loan, $1,850/month P&I (at 6.75%)
- **10% down on $300,000 home:** $270,000 loan, $1,752/month P&I (at 6.75%)
- **Savings:** $98/month

### 5. Buy in a Lower-Cost Area
If your desired home price exceeds your 28/36 budget, consider:
- Buying in a more affordable neighborhood
- Buying a smaller home
- Buying a fixer-upper and renovating over time

## Online Affordability Calculators (And Why They're Often Wrong)

Many online calculators estimate affordability based on aggressive DTI assumptions (45-50%), not the conservative 28/36 rule.

### What to Watch Out For
- **Default DTI assumptions:** Many calculators assume 43-45% DTI, inflating your budget
- **Optimistic interest rates:** Calculators may show rates lower than you'll actually get
- **Ignored costs:** Some calculators exclude PMI, HOA fees, or property tax increases

### How to Use Calculators Wisely
1. **Manually adjust DTI to 28/36** if the calculator allows
2. **Input your actual middle credit score** to get realistic rate estimates
3. **Add PMI, taxes, insurance, and HOA fees** to see your true monthly payment
4. **Add a 10-15% cushion** to account for unexpected costs

## Final Thoughts: Buy What You Can Afford, Not What You're Approved For

The 28/36 rule isn't a law—it's a guideline to help you avoid financial stress. Lenders will often approve you for more house than you can comfortably afford because they profit from larger loans.

But here's the truth: **just because you're approved for $450,000 doesn't mean you should spend $450,000.**

The sweet spot is finding a home that:
- Meets the 28/36 rule
- Leaves room for savings, travel, and life
- Doesn't cause financial anxiety
- Allows you to build wealth instead of just making payments

I bought a home at 32% DTI instead of 48% DTI, and it's given me financial freedom, peace of mind, and the ability to enjoy life—not just survive paycheck to paycheck.

Use the 28/36 rule as a starting point, then adjust based on your personal comfort zone. Your future self will thank you.
