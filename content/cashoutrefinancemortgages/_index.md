**Cash-out refinance mortgages** allow homeowners to access home equity by refinancing existing mortgages for amounts exceeding current loan balances—receiving cash difference at closing. Programs include conventional (80% LTV max, 620+ credit), FHA (80% LTV, 580+ credit), and VA (90-100% LTV for veterans). Strategic uses include debt consolidation (paying off high-interest credit cards, auto loans, student loans), home improvements (increasing property value), investment opportunities, or major expenses where equity access provides financial flexibility at lower mortgage rates versus alternative financing.

Understanding when cash-out refinance makes financial sense requires analyzing equity position, rate differential from current mortgage, intended use of proceeds, and total cost comparison over holding period.
