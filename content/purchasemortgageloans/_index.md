**Purchase mortgage loans** finance primary residence acquisitions through FHA (3.5% down, 640+ credit), conventional (3-20% down, 620+ credit), VA (0% down for military), and USDA (0% down for rural properties) programs. The right program depends on your credit score, down payment savings, and long-term goals—with FHA offering flexible qualification but permanent mortgage insurance, conventional requiring higher credit but removable PMI, and VA/USDA providing zero-down options for eligible borrowers. Choosing the wrong program costs $8,000-$15,000 over 5 years in unnecessary MI or missed qualification opportunities.
