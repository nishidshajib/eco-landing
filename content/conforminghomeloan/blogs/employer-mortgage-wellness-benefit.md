When our company refreshed its financial wellness program, the HR team asked employees what stressed them most. The top answer wasn’t retirement or student loans—it was figuring out how to qualify for a mortgage without getting ripped off. That insight led us to pilot a conforming loan education benefit. After six months, here’s what we learned, what employees loved, and how we measured success.

## Step 1: Define the problem accurately

Employees didn’t just want a “mortgage calculator.” They wanted unbiased guidance on conforming loan limits, debt-to-income ratios, middle credit scores, and when to refinance. We surveyed staff anonymously and discovered three themes:

1. Confusion about the documents lenders request and why.
2. Fear of shopping multiple lenders because of aggressive follow-up.
3. Lack of clarity on how PMI, LLPAs, and cash-out rules affect affordability.

Knowing the pain points helped us build a program that felt human, not corporate.

## Step 2: Partner with educators, not sales teams

We evaluated several vendors and chose a platform that focuses on education first. The content library included video walkthroughs of Loan Estimates, templates for letters of explanation, and workshops on reading AUS findings. Crucially, employees controlled when and if their information was shared with loan officers. That privacy safeguard boosted adoption because people felt safe exploring scenarios without instant sales calls.

## Step 3: Launch with storytelling

Instead of a dry memo, we hosted a lunch-and-learn titled “Demystifying Conforming Mortgages.” Two employees shared their recent homebuying experiences—one with a smooth conforming approval, one with a painful appraisal rework. Hearing colleagues describe both wins and challenges made the benefit feel relevant. HR then walked through the new portal, highlighting features like checklists, credit score explainers, and office hours with mortgage coaches.

## Step 4: Provide time and encouragement

We dedicated one Friday afternoon per month as “homeownership hour.” Employees could log into the portal, attend a live Q&A, or meet virtually with a mortgage coach without using PTO. Managers were encouraged to remind their teams and even attend sessions themselves. Participation skyrocketed when leadership modeled engagement.

## Step 5: Track meaningful metrics

Because the benefit was free, we measured success through qualitative and quantitative data:

- Number of employees attending sessions
- Surveyed confidence scores before and after the program
- Count of mortgage-related HR inquiries (which dropped by 42%)
- Retention among employees who engaged with the program (higher than the company average)

We also collected anonymous testimonials to share with leadership and prospective hires.

## What employees learned

- How conforming loan limits change annually and what that means for budgeting
- Why middle credit score matters more than the highest or lowest bureau score
- How to compare lender credits, points, and PMI structures
- What documentation to gather before pre-approval
- Strategies for timing cash-out refinances versus second liens

By the third month, employees were swapping amortization spreadsheets and sharing AUS success stories in Slack. Mortgage literacy became part of our culture.

## HR lessons for other companies

1. **Protect privacy.** Employees engage more when they control if lenders see their information.
2. **Focus on education.** Tools and calculators help, but live coaching makes the material stick.
3. **Integrate with existing wellness programs.** Position mortgage literacy alongside retirement planning and emergency savings.
4. **Celebrate milestones.** We send congratulatory notes when employees close on homes, reinforcing that the company supports their goals.
5. **Keep iterating.** We update workshops quarterly to cover new FHFA loan limits, rate trends, and regulatory changes.

Offering a conforming loan wellness benefit didn’t cost us money, but it paid dividends in loyalty and morale. Employees now talk about homeownership plans openly, help each other interpret Loan Estimates, and feel supported by their employer during one of life’s biggest financial decisions. That’s a win for everyone.
