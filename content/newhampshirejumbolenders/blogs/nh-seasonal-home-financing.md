## New Hampshire Seasonal Home Financing: What Lenders Want to Know

Lake Winnipesaukee and Lake Sunapee attract buyers who treat them as second homes or seasonal investments. But **seasonal homes face different lending rules than primary residences**.

### Why Seasonal Homes Are Harder to Finance
1. **Lower occupancy:** Part-time use reduces value perception and increases default risk
2. **Maintenance issues:** Seasonal wear can be deferred; property condition is riskier
3. **Resale uncertainty:** Seasonal markets can soften quickly
4. **Borrower priority:** Some lenders worry seasonal homes are less important than primary residences

### What National Lenders Typically Require
- **Higher credit scores** (740+ instead of 680+)
- **Higher down payments** (25–30% instead of 20%)
- **More reserves** (higher savings balances)
- **Owner-occupancy confirmation** (not investment/rental)

### What Portfolio Lenders Often Allow
- **700+ credit acceptable** (not always 740+)
- **20% down** (instead of 25%)
- **Flexible reserves** depending on equity
- **Investment/rental option** (more flexible occupancy rules)

### New Hampshire Tip
If you're financing a Lake Region seasonal home, **start with portfolio lenders** who understand the market. They often beat national jumbo rates and close faster because they handle seasonal property guidelines better.

Don't assume you'll need pristine credit and 30% down—portfolio lenders are often more flexible than you'd expect.
