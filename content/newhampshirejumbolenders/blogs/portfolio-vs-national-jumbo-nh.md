## Portfolio Lenders vs. National Jumbo Programs in New Hampshire

National jumbo lenders (UWM, LoanDepot, Better) offer consistency and broad product lines. New Hampshire portfolio lenders offer **flexibility and local market knowledge**. For many NH borrowers, portfolio lenders win.

### When Portfolio Lenders Win
- **Seasonal homes:** Portfolio lenders accept investment/vacation properties more easily
- **Investment rentals:** Custom terms and underwriting for multi-property landlords
- **Self-employed:** More flexible with business structures and tax returns
- **Lower down payments:** Sometimes allow 15–20% instead of 25%+

### When National Jumbo Programs Win
- **Consistent rates:** Large programs publish rates daily
- **Speed:** Automated underwriting moves fast
- **Product range:** Multiple loan programs and options
- **Rate locks:** Clear lock terms and pricing

### New Hampshire Example
On a $1M jumbo for an owner-occupied Lake Region home:
- **National lender:** 7.125% (automated pricing)
- **Portfolio lender:** 6.875% (manual review, local knowledge)

The portfolio lender understood the property, the market, and the borrower. That's 0.25% lower on a $1M loan = $250/month in savings.

### How to Compare Effectively
1. Get quotes from at least one national lender and one portfolio specialist.
2. Request **written terms** including rates, fees, and closing timelines.
3. Ask about New Hampshire-specific property rules (seasonal, investment, etc.).

Portfolio lenders are often overlooked but frequently offer better pricing on New Hampshire properties—especially if you don't fit a national lender's cookie-cutter profile.
