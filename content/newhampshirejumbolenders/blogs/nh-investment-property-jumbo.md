## Jumbo Rates for Investment Properties in New Hampshire: Portfolio Specialist Advantage

New Hampshire investors buying rental properties or vacation rentals (even above conforming limits) face **different jumbo pricing** than primary residence buyers. Understanding this difference can save thousands.

### Investment Property Jumbo Challenges
- **Debt-to-income limits:** Stricter DTI caps (often 36–40% vs. 43–45% primary)
- **Rate premiums:** Usually 0.375–0.75% higher than owner-occupied
- **Reserve requirements:** Higher savings/reserves required
- **Rental income calculation:** Conservative treatment of potential rental revenue

### Why Portfolio Lenders Win on Investment Jumbo
Portfolio lenders often:
- Underwrite more conservatively but **close faster**
- Accept cash reserves from business or portfolio
- Price rental income **at actual current** rates vs. standard multipliers
- Hold loans in-house (less regulatory pressure)

### Example: $1.2M Rental in New Hampshire
- **National jumbo lender:** 7.50% (strict DTI, rental income at standard cap)
- **Portfolio lender:** 7.00% (flexible reserves, actual rental income review)

The portfolio lender sees your full financial picture and prices accordingly. National lenders use automated tiers that often penalize investors unfairly.

### Bottom Line
If you're buying a New Hampshire investment property above the $766,550 jumbo threshold, **don't accept the first jumbo offer**. Compare portfolio specialists who understand rental property fundamentals.
