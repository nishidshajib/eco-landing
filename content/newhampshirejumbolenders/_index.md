New Hampshire jumbo lending works differently than most states because **portfolio lenders compete effectively with national jumbo programs**. That competition creates better pricing and flexibility for borrowers with non-traditional situations.

The conforming limit in New Hampshire is **$766,550**. Loans above that are jumbo, and pricing shifts based on credit tier, down payment, and property type. Seasonal homes and investment properties can face stricter guidelines or higher rates from national lenders—but portfolio specialists often offer custom terms.

New Hampshire's Lake Region and coastal markets attract buyers willing to pay premium prices, which means jumbo lending is actively competitive. Smart borrowers compare **3–5 sources**: national jumbo lenders (UWM, LoanDepot, Better), local banks, and regional portfolio specialists.
