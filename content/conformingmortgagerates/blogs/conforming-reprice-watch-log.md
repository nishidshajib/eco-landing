Nothing spikes blood pressure like a surprise lender reprice. Your phone lights up, borrowers panic, and suddenly every stakeholder wants an update five minutes ago. To keep those moments orderly we maintain a “reprice watch log,” a single document that tracks volatility across all active conforming loans. The log has five columns, a few automation rules, and a playbook that anyone on the team can follow. Here’s how it works.

## Column 1: Trigger snapshot

Each row starts with the trigger—maybe a morning mortgage-backed securities drop, a Fed speaker, or an internal lender bulletin. We paste the exact language from the source, highlight the timestamp, and include the state(s) most likely to be impacted. This alone stops rumors in their tracks; when someone claims “rates are up half a point,” we can point to the actual statement and see whether that’s true.

## Column 2: Borrower exposure

Next we list every borrower affected by the trigger. This includes property type, expected closing date, lock status, and any unique documentation concerns. By organizing this data we can prioritize communication. For example, a borrower closing within ten days gets immediate outreach, while someone still gathering documents might only need a heads-up in the weekly digest.

## Column 3: Lender response

We then log how each lender on our shortlist reacted. Did they reprice up, reprice down, or hold steady? We note the exact rate change, whether points shifted, and if any new conditions were introduced. When possible we attach supporting documentation—screenshots, email threads, or portal announcements—so future readers can confirm the facts. This column doubles as leverage during negotiations because it shows we are monitoring competitors in real time.

## Column 4: Action taken

This is the heart of the log. For every borrower we document the action, owner, and deadline. Actions may include requesting a lock extension, initiating a float-down conversation, preparing escalation scripts, or scheduling a stakeholder briefing. We treat action entries like tasks in a project management tool, complete with checkboxes and color-coded status indicators.

## Column 5: Outcome + lessons

After the dust settles we record the outcome: whether the borrower accepted the new pricing, whether we secured a concession, or whether the loan moved to a backup lender. This column is never optional. Every reprice is a learning opportunity, and the notes we capture here feed directly into future training sessions and blog posts like this one.

## Automation rules keep the log fresh

The log lives in a shared workspace with a few simple automations. When a row is created, alert emails go to the assigned owners. If an action deadline passes without completion, the row turns red and escalates to leadership. We also sync the log with our communication templates so drafting borrower updates takes minutes, not hours.

## Communication flows from the log

The moment a row is created we send three messages: a borrower-facing summary, an internal Slack update, and a note to our realtor or financial planner partners. Each message links back to the log so recipients can see the context. Because the log already contains the macro story, the lender response, and the plan, our messages stay short and confident.

## Results worth the effort

Maintaining the reprice watch log takes discipline, but it has paid off. Borrowers no longer feel blindsided, team members know exactly where to look for status, and lenders respect that we track their moves with precision. Most importantly, the log keeps us from making rash decisions during volatile days. Instead of chasing every rate blip, we follow the process, execute the plan, and document the outcome for next time.

If lender reprices routinely wreck your week, try building a watch log. Start with the five columns above, assign ownership, and treat every entry as a chance to improve your playbook. Calm communication is a competitive advantage, and the log is how we create it.
