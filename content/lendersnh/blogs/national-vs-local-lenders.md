New Hampshire borrowers choosing between **national lenders** (Rocket, Better, Guaranteed Rate) and **local lenders** (Service CU, TD Bank, St. Mary's) face trade-offs between technology-driven efficiency and local market expertise.

## How National Lenders Work

National direct lenders operate **online-first business models**:

**Rocket Mortgage:**
- Fully digital application and document upload
- Automated underwriting in 24–48 hours
- Offshore processing teams (India, Philippines) for cost reduction
- National scale ($90B+ annual originations)
- E-closing options in most states

**Better.com:**
- App-based mortgage experience
- No loan officer commissions (saves 0.50%–1.00% vs retail)
- Automated rate quotes in real-time
- Fast closings (15–25 days average)
- Venture capital funded, technology focused

**Guaranteed Rate:**
- Hybrid model (online + local loan officers in some markets)
- Digital application with human support
- Competitive FHA/VA pricing
- National footprint with regional processing centers

### National Lender Advantages:

1. **Speed**: 20–25 day closings vs 30–40 for local banks
2. **Technology**: Mobile apps, automated underwriting, e-signatures
3. **Competitive pricing**: Low overhead = rates matching or beating local banks
4. **Convenience**: 24/7 online access, no in-person meetings required
5. **Transparency**: Real-time rate quotes, digital status tracking

### National Lender Disadvantages:

1. **No local market knowledge**: Don't understand NH seasonal homes, septic systems, winter access issues
2. **Limited portfolio lending**: Fannie/Freddie only—no manual underwriting for edge cases
3. **Offshore processing**: Customer service in different time zones
4. **Less flexibility**: Automated systems may decline scenarios local underwriters would approve manually
5. **No relationship banking**: You're a loan number, not a local customer

## How Local NH Lenders Work

Local lenders include **credit unions, regional banks, and community banks**:

**Service Credit Union (Portsmouth):**
- In-person or online application
- NH-based underwriting teams
- Local servicing (pay at branch or online)
- Member-focused non-profit structure
- Relationship discounts for deposits

**TD Bank / Citizens Bank:**
- Regional bank presence across NH
- Portfolio lending divisions for complex scenarios
- In-house underwriting (manual flexibility)
- Relationship pricing for existing customers
- Branch network for in-person service

**St. Mary's Bank (Manchester):**
- Community bank with 115-year NH history
- Portfolio jumbo and self-employed programs
- Personal loan officer relationships
- Manual underwriting for unique properties
- Local decision-making authority

### Local Lender Advantages:

1. **NH market expertise**: Understand seasonal homes, Lakes Region properties, condo complexes
2. **Portfolio lending**: Manual underwriting for self-employed, investors, credit challenges
3. **Relationship banking**: Loan officers know you personally, not offshore call center
4. **Local servicing**: Pay at NH branches, talk to NH-based customer service
5. **Manual underwriting**: Flexibility for scenarios automated systems decline

### Local Lender Disadvantages:

1. **Slower processing**: 30–40 days vs 20–25 for national lenders
2. **Less technology**: Manual document collection, fewer digital tools
3. **Limited hours**: Business hours only vs 24/7 online access
4. **Higher overhead**: Branch networks = higher costs = slightly higher rates (for banks)
5. **Geographic focus**: May not have experience with out-of-state income/properties

## Rate Comparison: National vs Local

### Example 1: Standard Portsmouth Conventional Purchase

**Scenario:** $500k purchase, 20% down, 740 credit, W-2 income

**Rocket Mortgage:**
- Rate: 6.250%
- Origination: $1,500
- APR: 6.362%

**Service Credit Union (local):**
- Rate: 6.125%
- Origination: $1,000
- APR: 6.231%

**Winner: Service CU** (0.131% APR advantage = $500/year savings)

### Example 2: Manchester FHA First-Time Buyer

**Scenario:** $350k purchase, 3.5% down, 680 credit

**Better.com:**
- Rate: 6.000%
- Origination: $0 (no loan officer commissions)
- APR: 6.098%

**Granite State CU (local):**
- Rate: 6.000%
- Origination: $1,200
- APR: 6.174%

**Winner: Better** (0.076% APR advantage = $225/year savings)

### Example 3: Self-Employed Nashua Borrower

**Scenario:** $450k purchase, 15% down, self-employed 1099 income

**Guaranteed Rate:**
- **Declines application** (tax returns show low AGI, automated underwriting says no)

**St. Mary's Bank (local):**
- Rate: 6.625% (portfolio bank statement loan)
- Origination: $2,500
- APR: 6.812%
- **Approved** using 12 months business bank statements

**Winner: St. Mary's** (only lender that approves—rate comparison irrelevant)

## When National Lenders Win

National lenders excel for:

### 1. Standard W-2 Conventional/FHA Loans
Clean income, strong credit, standard property = automated underwriting works perfectly. Speed and efficiency matter more than local expertise.

### 2. Fast Closing Needs
Rocket and Better close in 15–25 days vs 30–40 for local banks. If you need speed (competitive market, tight contract timeline), national lenders deliver.

### 3. Tech-Savvy Borrowers
If you prefer mobile app experience over in-person meetings, national lenders provide better UX. Upload docs from phone, track status in real-time.

### 4. FHA/VA with Perfect Income Documentation
National lenders excel at government loans with clean W-2 income. Competitive pricing and fast automated underwriting.

### 5. No Relationship Banking Needed
If you don't care about knowing your loan officer personally or having local servicing, national efficiency wins.

## When Local NH Lenders Win

Local lenders excel for:

### 1. Self-Employed Income
Portfolio underwriting via St. Mary's, TD Bank, or Citizens uses bank statements or P&L instead of tax returns. National lenders require full tax return AGI.

### 2. Unique NH Properties
Seasonal homes, winter-access properties, septic systems, condo conversions—local underwriters understand NH nuances. National lenders may decline or require extra documentation.

### 3. Investment Properties
Local banks approve 5–10 financed properties. National lenders often cap at 4. Portfolio flexibility matters for NH investors.

### 4. Credit Challenges (620–680 scores)
Local credit unions do manual underwriting at 620–680 credit. National lenders may auto-decline below 680 even if Fannie allows it.

### 5. Jumbo Loans with Complexity
St. Mary's or TD portfolio jumbo underwriting handles self-employed, unique properties, or high DTI. National lenders stick to agency jumbo guidelines (limited flexibility).

### 6. Relationship Discounts
Existing TD or Citizens customers with $100k+ deposits get rate discounts (0.125%–0.25%). National lenders don't offer relationship pricing.

## Processing Speed Reality

**Myth:** National lenders always close faster.

**Reality:** National lenders close faster **on standard scenarios only**.

**Standard conventional purchase (W-2, 740+ credit, clean title):**
- National: 15–25 days
- Local: 25–35 days
- **Advantage: National** (10 days faster)

**Self-employed purchase (1099, manual underwriting, portfolio loan):**
- National: Declines or requires extensive documentation → 45+ days
- Local: Manual underwriting tuned for complexity → 30–40 days
- **Advantage: Local** (handles scenario national lenders can't)

## Technology Comparison

**National lenders:**
- Mobile apps with real-time rate quotes
- Automated document upload (take photo of W-2, app recognizes it)
- E-signature for all disclosures
- Digital closing options (hybrid or full remote)
- 24/7 online account access

**Local lenders:**
- Basic online portals (improving but behind national)
- Email/fax document submission (some have upload portals)
- E-signature becoming standard
- In-person closings typical (some offer hybrid e-closing)
- Business hours customer service

**Winner: National** (significant technology advantage)

## Customer Service Differences

**National lenders:**
- Offshore call centers (India, Philippines)
- Ticket-based support systems
- Different representative each call
- 24/7 availability but less personalization

**Local lenders:**
- NH-based loan officers and processors
- Direct phone number to your loan officer
- Same person through closing
- Business hours only but more personal

**Winner: Personal preference** (efficiency vs relationship)

## NH-Specific Scenarios Where Local Wins

### Lakes Region Seasonal Homes
**Issue:** Winter road access restrictions, seasonal water shutoffs

**National lender:** May require winter appraisal interior access (impossible if home is winterized)

**Local lender:** Understands seasonal properties, allows exterior-only appraisal or spring closing timing

### Septic System Requirements
**Issue:** NH homes often have septic vs sewer

**National lender:** May require full septic inspection/pumping for all transactions

**Local lender:** Knows when septic inspection is necessary vs accepting seller certification

### Condo Complex Approvals
**Issue:** NH has many small condo complexes with <50% owner-occupancy

**National lender:** Auto-declines non-warrantable condos

**Local lender:** Portfolio approval for non-warrantable condos if financials are strong

### White Mountains Vacation Rentals
**Issue:** Property used as short-term rental but borrower claims as second home

**National lender:** Automated systems may flag as investment property (higher rates)

**Local lender:** Loan officer uses judgment—if borrower uses property personally, approves as second home

## Rate Lock and Float Strategies

**National lenders:**
- Transparent rate lock pricing (online rate sheets)
- Float-down options common ($500–$1,000 fee)
- Lock extensions expensive ($0.125%+ rate increase)

**Local lenders:**
- Rate lock pricing less transparent (ask loan officer)
- Float-down negotiable (relationship-based)
- Lock extensions may be free for good customers

## Which Lender Type Should You Choose?

**Use National Lender (Rocket, Better, Guaranteed Rate) if:**
- W-2 income, strong credit (680+), standard property
- You want fastest closing (15–25 days)
- Tech-savvy, prefer mobile app over in-person meetings
- No relationship with local banks/credit unions
- FHA/VA with clean income documentation

**Use Local Lender (Service CU, St. Mary's, TD Bank) if:**
- Self-employed or complex income (commission, bonus, rental)
- Credit score 620–680 (need manual underwriting flexibility)
- Unique NH property (seasonal, septic, non-warrantable condo)
- Investment property (especially 5th+ financed property)
- Want relationship banking and local servicing
- Jumbo loan with complexity

**Best Strategy: Get Both Quotes**

Compare:
1. **National lender** (Rocket or Better for speed/tech benchmark)
2. **Local credit union** (Service CU or Granite State for best local rate)
3. **Local bank** (TD or St. Mary's if portfolio lending needed)

Choose based on **approval confidence + total cost (APR) + service fit**.

## The Hybrid Approach

Some NH borrowers use **local loan officer with national lender backing**:

**Guaranteed Rate** has local NH loan officers who provide personal service but underwrite through national platform. You get:
- Local relationship (meet in-person, direct phone number)
- National technology and pricing
- Hybrid processing (local LO + national underwriting)

This splits the difference between pure national (Rocket, Better) and pure local (credit unions).

## The Bottom Line

**National lenders win on:**
- Speed (15–25 days)
- Technology (mobile apps, automation)
- Convenience (24/7, no in-person meetings)

**Local NH lenders win on:**
- Portfolio lending (self-employed, investors, credit challenges)
- NH market expertise (seasonal homes, septic, unique properties)
- Relationship banking (personal service, local decision-making)

For standard W-2 conventional/FHA loans, **national and local lenders are increasingly competitive on pricing**—choose based on service preference. For complex scenarios (self-employed, unique properties, credit challenges), **local NH lenders provide approval flexibility** national automated systems cannot match.
