New Hampshire portfolio lenders offer **manual underwriting** and **non-agency loan programs** for borrowers who don't fit Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac guidelines—including self-employed, investors with 5+ properties, and credit-challenged borrowers.

## What is Portfolio Lending?

**Portfolio lenders** keep loans on their balance sheet instead of selling to Fannie/Freddie:

**Agency lending (most lenders):**
1. Lender originates loan following Fannie/Freddie guidelines
2. Lender sells loan to Fannie/Freddie within 30–90 days
3. Lender gets capital back to fund more loans
4. Borrower's loan is serviced by Fannie/Freddie servicer

**Portfolio lending:**
1. Lender originates loan using **in-house guidelines** (may differ from Fannie/Freddie)
2. Lender **keeps loan on balance sheet** (doesn't sell)
3. Lender services loan directly
4. Borrower pays lender throughout loan life

Portfolio lending allows **manual underwriting flexibility** for scenarios agency guidelines prohibit.

## When to Use Portfolio Lending

Portfolio lenders solve these common NH scenarios:

### 1. Self-Employed with Strong Income but Low Tax Returns

**Problem:** You earn $150k/year but tax deductions reduce AGI to $60k—agency underwriting uses $60k

**Portfolio Solution:** TD Bank or St. Mary's uses 12–24 months business bank statements:
- Average monthly deposits: $12,500
- Annualized income: $150k
- Qualified at actual income vs tax return AGI

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.75% portfolio vs 6.25% agency (if you could qualify)—worth it to get approved

### 2. Investor with 5+ Financed Properties

**Problem:** You own 4 financed rentals, want to buy 5th—most lenders cap at 4 properties

**Portfolio Solution:** TD Bank, Citizens, or St. Mary's portfolio investor programs approve 5–10 properties:
- Underwrite rental income at 75%–100% (vs 50%–75% agency)
- Manual review of portfolio performance
- Higher down payment (25%–30%) but approval possible

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.875% portfolio vs 6.50% agency jumbo—worth it to expand portfolio

### 3. Cash-Out Refinance Over 80% LTV

**Problem:** Need $60k cash-out but have only 25% equity—agency caps at 80% LTV

**Portfolio Solution:** TD Bank portfolio cash-out to 85% LTV:
- $400k home value
- Existing mortgage: $240k
- New loan: $340k (85% LTV)
- Cash out: $100k minus closing costs

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.875% portfolio vs 6.375% agency at 80%—decision is whether extra cash access is worth 0.50% rate

### 4. Non-Warrantable Condo

**Problem:** Your condo complex has 55% investor-owned units—agency requires 50%+ owner-occupied

**Portfolio Solution:** Citizens or St. Mary's portfolio condo approval:
- Manual review of HOA financials (reserves, delinquency rate)
- If complex is financially strong, approve despite investor concentration
- May require larger down payment (15%–20% vs 10%)

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.75% portfolio vs 6.375% agency (if it were warrantable)

### 5. Credit Score 620–660 with Strong Compensating Factors

**Problem:** 640 credit score—many agency lenders have 680 minimum overlays

**Portfolio Solution:** St. Mary's or Granite State CU manual underwriting:
- Strong employment (10 years same employer)
- Large down payment (20%+)
- Low DTI (30%)
- Underwriter approves manually despite 640 credit

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.625% portfolio vs 6.25% agency at 680+ credit

### 6. Seasonal Lakes Region Property

**Problem:** Year-round access questionable—winter road may not be plowed

**Portfolio Solution:** Bellwether CCU or St. Mary's seasonal property expertise:
- Understand Lakes Region market
- Accept seasonal access properties other lenders decline
- May require appraisal timing (spring/summer vs winter)

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.50% portfolio vs potential decline at agency lender

### 7. Jumbo Loan with Complex Income

**Problem:** $1.2M loan, self-employed, strong assets but variable income

**Portfolio Solution:** St. Mary's or TD portfolio jumbo:
- Manual underwriting using asset depletion or bank statements
- Larger down payment (25%–30%)
- Relationship banking consideration (deposit accounts, business banking)

**Rate Trade-off:** 6.75%–7.00% portfolio vs 6.50% agency jumbo (if you could document income)

## Portfolio Lending Rate Premiums

Expect to pay **0.25%–0.50% higher rates** for portfolio vs agency lending:

**Conventional agency:** 6.250%
**Portfolio conventional:** 6.500%–6.750%

**Agency jumbo:** 6.500%
**Portfolio jumbo:** 6.750%–7.250%

**Why higher rates?**
- Lender holds credit risk (can't sell to Fannie/Freddie)
- Higher default risk scenarios (self-employed, investors, credit challenges)
- Lower liquidity (can't quickly sell loan portfolio for capital)

## Portfolio Lending Down Payment Requirements

Portfolio lenders often require **larger down payments** than agency:

**Agency conventional:** 3%–5% down minimum
**Portfolio conventional:** 10%–20% down typical

**Agency jumbo:** 10%–20% down
**Portfolio jumbo:** 20%–30% down typical

**Investment property agency:** 15%–25% down
**Investment property portfolio:** 25%–30% down typical

Larger down payments reduce lender risk on portfolio loans they're keeping on balance sheet.

## How to Qualify for NH Portfolio Lending

Portfolio lenders look for **compensating factors**:

1. **Strong credit history** (even if score is 620–680, want clean payment history)
2. **Stable employment** (2+ years same employer/industry)
3. **Low debt-to-income** (prefer 40% or below vs 50% max)
4. **Reserves** (6–12 months PITI in savings)
5. **Large down payment** (20%–30% reduces lender risk)
6. **Relationship banking** (existing deposits, business accounts)

The more compensating factors, the better portfolio approval odds and pricing.

## Portfolio Lending Timeline

Portfolio loans take **30–45 days** to close:

**Why longer than agency (25–30 days)?**
- Manual underwriting (human review vs automated)
- Custom documentation requirements
- Portfolio committee approvals (not just one underwriter)
- Relationship verification (if using deposit accounts for approval)

Plan for longer timeline when using portfolio lending.

## Questions to Ask NH Portfolio Lenders

Before applying, ask:

1. **"Do you keep these loans in your portfolio or sell them?"**
   - Verify it's true portfolio vs brokering to another lender

2. **"What's the rate premium for portfolio vs agency pricing?"**
   - Should be 0.25%–0.50%, not 1.00%+

3. **"What compensating factors improve my approval odds?"**
   - Larger down payment? More reserves? Lower DTI?

4. **"What documentation do you need for self-employed income?"**
   - 12 or 24 months bank statements? Personal and business?

5. **"Do you have maximum property count for investors?"**
   - Some portfolio lenders cap at 6–8, others go to 10+

6. **"What's your typical portfolio loan timeline?"**
   - 30–45 days is reasonable, 60+ suggests inefficient process

## Portfolio Lending Red Flags

Avoid portfolio lenders who:

1. **Charge excessive fees** (3%+ origination on portfolio loans)
2. **Quote rates 1%+ above agency** (portfolio premium should be 0.25%–0.50%)
3. **Require prepayment penalties** (some portfolio lenders lock you in 3–5 years)
4. **Have poor servicing reviews** (you'll pay them for 30 years—check BBB/Google reviews)
5. **Lack NH market experience** (out-of-state portfolio lenders may not understand seasonal properties, septic, etc.)

## NH Portfolio Lender Recommendations

**Best overall NH portfolio lender:**
**St. Mary's Bank** (credit union pricing + portfolio flexibility + 115 years NH experience)

**Best for jumbo portfolio:**
**TD Bank** (up to $3M, strong regional presence)

**Best for investors:**
**Citizens Bank** (5–10 properties, relationship pricing)

**Best for Lakes Region seasonal:**
**Bellwether Community CU** (local expertise, competitive rates)

**Best for self-employed:**
**St. Mary's or TD** (bank statement programs, flexible underwriting)

## The Bottom Line on NH Portfolio Lending

New Hampshire portfolio lenders provide **approval flexibility** for self-employed, investors, credit-challenged, and unique property scenarios that agency lenders decline.

Rate trade-off is typically **0.25%–0.50% higher** than agency pricing—a worthwhile premium when portfolio lending is your only approval option or when manual underwriting recognizes income/assets automated systems miss.

For complex scenarios, start with NH portfolio lenders (St. Mary's, TD, Citizens) before trying agency lenders—you'll save time and improve approval odds with underwriters who have authority to say "yes" to non-standard situations.
