New Hampshire credit unions consistently offer **mortgage rates 0.125%–0.25% below retail banks** due to non-profit structure and member-focused pricing. The three largest NH mortgage credit unions are Service Credit Union, Granite State Credit Union, and St. Mary's Bank.

## Why NH Credit Unions Have Better Rates

Credit unions are **non-profit member cooperatives**:

- No shareholder profit requirements = tighter margins on loans
- Member surplus returned via better rates and lower fees
- Lower overhead than retail banks (fewer branches, lean staffing)

Typical NH credit union rate advantage: **0.125%–0.25% below Bank of America, TD Bank, or Citizens Bank** on conventional and FHA loans.

## Credit Union vs Bank Rate Math

**Service Credit Union:**
- Rate: 6.125%
- Origination: $1,000

**TD Bank (retail):**
- Rate: 6.375%

## How to Join NH Credit Unions

All three major NH credit unions have **easy membership requirements**:

1. **Open savings account** ($5–$25 initial deposit)
2. **Verify NH connection** (live, work, worship, or attend school in state)
3. **Apply for mortgage** (same underwriting as banks, just better rates)

Many NH residents qualify for **all three credit unions**—get quotes from each to compare.

## Credit Union Underwriting Standards

NH credit unions follow **Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac guidelines** for agency loans:

- Minimum 620 credit (some offer manual underwriting down to 580)
- DTI up to 50% with strong compensating factors
- 3%–5% down on conventional (same as banks)
- FHA 3.5% down, VA 0% down

**Difference from banks:** Credit unions typically have **fewer overlays**:
- Banks add restrictions (minimum 680 credit, max 45% DTI)
- Credit unions stick closer to agency minimums
- Better approval odds for 620–680 credit scores

## Portfolio Lending at NH Credit Unions

While most CU mortgages are sold to Fannie/Freddie, some maintain **portfolio divisions**:

**St. Mary's Bank:**
- Best NH credit union for portfolio lending
- Self-employed bank statement loans
- Jumbo up to $2M with manual underwriting
- Investment properties 5–10 financed

**Granite State CU:**
- Selective portfolio for unique scenarios
- Good for 4th investment property (banks often cap at 4)
- Manual underwriting for credit challenges

**Service CU:**
- Limited portfolio lending (mostly agency conforming)
- May keep loans in-house for servicing but still follow agency rules

## Credit Union Service Differences

**Advantages:**
- Local underwriting (knows NH market nuances)
- In-person service at branches (less common with national lenders)
- Loan officers are salaried (not commission) = less sales pressure
- Local servicing (pay at branch or online, talk to NH-based reps)

**Trade-offs:**
- Slower technology adoption (less digital than Rocket/Better)
- Smaller teams may mean longer processing (30–40 days vs 20–25 for national lenders)
- Limited evening/weekend hours vs 24/7 online lender support

## Which NH Credit Union Should You Choose?

**Choose Service CU if:**
- You want absolute lowest conventional rates (740+ credit)
- Portsmouth/Seacoast location (convenient branches)
- You value in-house servicing vs national servicer
- Standard W-2 income, strong credit, conventional/FHA/VA

**Choose Granite State CU if:**
- FHA or VA loan (competitive pricing)
- Credit score 620–680 (good manual underwriting)
- Buying 2nd–4th investment property
- Need NHHFA program access

**Choose St. Mary's Bank if:**
- Self-employed with complex income
- Jumbo loan needing manual underwriting
- Investment property portfolio (5+ properties)
- Manchester/southern NH location preference
- Unique property type (seasonal, condo conversion)

## Best Strategy: Get All Three Quotes

Smart NH borrowers get quotes from:

1. **Service Credit Union** (benchmark for best conventional rate)
2. **Granite State CU** (compare FHA/VA and investor pricing)
3. **St. Mary's Bank** (if self-employed or portfolio loan needed)

Compare APR (not just rate) and choose based on **total cost + service fit**. Credit union membership is free/cheap—no reason not to join all three and compare.

## The Bottom Line on NH Credit Union Mortgages

New Hampshire credit unions deliver **0.125%–0.25% rate advantages** over retail banks on conventional and FHA loans. Service CU typically offers best conventional pricing, Granite State excels at FHA/VA, and St. Mary's provides strongest portfolio lending.

For most NH borrowers with standard W-2 income and good credit, credit unions beat banks and often match or beat national lenders—with added benefit of local service and in-state underwriting that understands New Hampshire market nuances.
