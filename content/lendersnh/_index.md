New Hampshire mortgage lenders include **local credit unions, regional banks, and national direct lenders**—each offering different advantages for rates, service, and approval flexibility.

**Credit unions** (Service CU, Granite State CU, St. Mary's Bank) provide member-focused pricing typically **0.125%–0.25% below retail banks** on conventional and FHA loans. Non-profit structure means lower overhead and tighter margins passed to members.

**Regional banks** (TD Bank, Citizens, Eastern Bank) offer **portfolio lending** for self-employed borrowers, investors, and unique property types. In-house underwriting allows flexibility beyond automated Fannie/Freddie guidelines.

**National direct lenders** (Rocket, Better, Guaranteed Rate) deliver **technology-driven efficiency** with competitive pricing and fast closings. Automated underwriting and digital processes reduce timeline to 20–25 days.

Understanding which NH lender type matches your scenario—standard W-2 purchase, self-employed income, investment property, or jumbo loan—determines your best rate and approval odds across Portsmouth, Manchester, Lakes Region, and statewide markets.
