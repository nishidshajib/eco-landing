Arizona first-time buyers have multiple paths to homeownership through **FHA loans with 3.5% down, conventional first-time buyer programs, and down payment assistance grants**. Starting with the right program—matched to your credit score and financial situation—significantly impacts approval odds and total costs.

**Understanding your options, getting pre-approved, and comparing lenders helps first-time Arizona buyers build equity instead of paying rent.** Begin your homeownership journey with education, preparation, and smart program selection.
