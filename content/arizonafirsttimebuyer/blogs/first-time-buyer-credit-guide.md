### Credit Score Impact: Real Dollar Examples

**$300,000 Phoenix Purchase, 30-Year Mortgage**

| Credit Score | Program | Rate | Monthly P&I + MI/PMI | 30-Year Interest | Monthly Savings vs Lowest |
|------------|---------|------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 740+ | Conventional | 6.25% | $1,689 | $307,620 | Baseline |
| 700-739 | Conventional | 6.50% | $1,746 | $328,560 | -$57/month |
| 680-699 | FHA | 6.75% | $1,768 | $336,240 | -$79/month |
| 620-679 | FHA | 7.00% | $1,845 | $364,200 | -$156/month |
| 580-619 | FHA | 7.30% | $1,927 | $383,520 | -$238/month |

**Cost impact analysis:**

- 740+ vs 620-679 credit: **$1,872/year difference** (almost $56,000 over 30 years)
- 740+ vs 580-619 credit: **$2,856/year difference** (almost $86,000 over 30 years)
- Improving from 600 to 700 credit: **$47,400 savings** over 30 years

**Key insight:** Even modest credit improvement—say from 620 to 680 (60 points)—saves approximately $2,000/year or $60,000 over 30 years.

### Credit Score Building Strategies for First-Time Buyers

**Strategy 1: Reduce Credit Card Utilization (Fastest Impact)**

*Timeline: 1–3 months*
*Potential improvement: 10–30 points*
*Effort: Moderate*

Credit utilization (amount owed divided by limit) heavily influences credit scores:
- **Utilization 80%+:** Severely damages score
- **Utilization 50–79%:** Moderate damage
- **Utilization 30–49%:** Minor impact
- **Utilization <10%:** Ideal (best scores)

**Action plan:**

1. List all credit cards with balances and limits
2. Target high-utilization cards first (those at 50%+ usage)
3. Pay down largest balances to <30% utilization
4. Focus on 1–2 cards initially (easier than managing many)

**Example: Sarah's credit card improvement**

*Before:*
- Card 1: $50K limit, $35K balance = 70% utilization (bad)
- Card 2: $20K limit, $4K balance = 20% utilization (good)
- Credit score: 650

*Action:*
- Pay Card 1 down to $8K (16% utilization)
- Total utilization drops from 60% to 27%

*Result:*
- Credit score improvement: 650 → 675 (+25 points) in 1–2 billing cycles
- New rate available: FHA 6.90% vs previous 7.25% (0.35% improvement)
- Monthly payment reduction: $40–50/month
- 30-year savings: $14,400–18,000

---

**Strategy 2: Payment History Perfection (Most Important)**

*Timeline: 6 months minimum*
*Potential improvement: 20–50 points*
*Effort: Low (automatic if set up)*

Payment history is 35% of credit score—the single largest factor. **One late payment damages score 50–100 points; six months of on-time payments begin recovery.**

**Action plan:**

1. Set up automatic bill pay for all accounts (minimum payment)
2. Track payment dates (avoid unintended misses)
3. Prioritize credit cards over other bills (score impact highest)
4. If missed payment exists, don't miss future payments (shows recent responsibility)

**Payment history impact timeline:**

- Late payment made: Score drops immediately (50–100 points)
- 30 days on-time after late: Score begins recovery (5–10 points back)
- 6 months on-time: Significant recovery (30–50 points recovered)
- 12 months on-time: Most damage recovered (50–80 points recovered)
- 24 months on-time: Late payment largely forgiven (score normalizes)

**Example: Marcus's late payment recovery**

*Timeline:*
- Month 0: Late payment made (30 days late) → Score drops to 620
- Month 6: Six months on-time payments → Score improves to 650
- Month 12: Twelve months on-time payments → Score reaches 680
- Result: Went from FHA-only approval (620) to conventional options available (680)

---

**Strategy 3: Dispute Inaccurate Items (Potential Quick Win)**

*Timeline: 30–60 days*
*Potential improvement: 10–50 points*
*Effort: Low*

Credit reports sometimes contain errors: incorrect balances, accounts in your name you didn't open, or old late payments that should be removed.

**Action plan:**

1. Get free credit reports: AnnualCreditReport.com (not consumer portals like Credit Karma)
2. Review each account carefully for errors
3. Dispute inaccuracies with the credit bureau in writing
4. Bureaus have 30 days to investigate; resolution within 60 days

**Common dispute scenarios:**

- *Incorrect balance:* "My credit report shows $5,000 owed on Card X, but current balance is $2,000"
- *Account not mine:* "This account doesn't belong to me; I did not authorize it"
- *Paid collection:* "This collection is marked unpaid, but I have proof of payment"
- *Outdated late payment:* "This late payment is older than 7 years and should be removed"

**Dispute impact:**

- Successful dispute removal: 10–50 point improvement possible
- Inaccurate collection removal: 30–80 point improvement possible
- Unlikely to generate improvement: Disputes of accurate information

---

**Strategy 4: Build Credit with Secured Cards (For Very Low Credit)**

*Timeline: 6–12 months*
*Potential improvement: 30–80 points*
*Effort: Moderate (requires cash deposit)*

If credit score below 600, traditional credit cards won't approve. Secured credit cards use cash deposits ($300–$1,500) as security and report to credit bureaus like regular cards.

**How secured cards work:**

1. Deposit cash as security (becomes credit limit)
2. Use card like normal credit card (make purchases, pay bill)
3. Make on-time payments (critical for score improvement)
4. After 6–12 months, card converts to regular credit card or limit increases
5. Deposit returned after successful history

**Credit improvement path:**

- Secured card for 6 months on-time payments: +30–50 points
- Second on-time cycle (6–12 months): +20–30 more points
- Total potential: 580 → 640+ in 12–18 months

**Example cards:**
- Capital One Secured
- Discover Secured
- Wells Fargo Secured
- US Bank Secured

---

**Strategy 5: Become Authorized User (Leverage Existing Credit)**

*Timeline: Immediate*
*Potential improvement: 5–20 points*
*Effort: Low*

If someone with good credit adds you as authorized user on their account, that account history appears on your credit report.

**Requirements:**
- Existing relationship with someone with good credit (parent, spouse, trusted family)
- Their willingness to add you to account
- Their account must have good payment history
- Account must be in good standing

**Caution:**
- If authorized user account goes delinquent, your score damaged too
- Only use with trusted relationships
- Works best with accounts having long positive history

---

**Strategy 6: Avoid These Credit-Damaging Actions**

❌ **Don't apply for new credit** (hard inquiries drop score 5–10 points each)
❌ **Don't close old accounts** (reduces available credit; hurts utilization ratio)
❌ **Don't pay off debt rapidly before applying** (multiple payments in short time looks risky)
❌ **Don't miss payments** (single late payment = -50 to -100 points)
❌ **Don't take large new debt** (DTI increases; lender approval jeopardized)
❌ **Don't ignore errors on credit report** (inaccuracies hurt your score)
