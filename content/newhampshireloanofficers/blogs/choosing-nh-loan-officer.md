## How to Choose the Right New Hampshire Loan Officer for Your Situation

Not all loan officers are created equal. Some specialize in first-time buyers, others in jumbo loans or seasonal properties. **Choosing the right NH loan officer** can save thousands and prevent application disasters.

### Questions to Ask Before Committing
1. **How many lenders do you work with?** (Look for 10+ wholesale sources)
2. **Do you handle [your specific program]?** (NHHFA, VA, jumbo, etc.)
3. **How many closings in my area last year?** (Local experience matters)
4. **Can you provide references?** (Talk to past clients)
5. **What's your typical closing timeline?** (30–45 days is standard)

### Red Flags to Avoid
- **Pressure to apply immediately** (good loan officers educate first)
- **Vague fee explanations** (request a detailed Loan Estimate)
- **No local experience** (out-of-state loan officers miss NH nuances)
- **One-size-fits-all advice** (your situation should drive recommendations)

### Specialization Matters
**First-time buyers:** Choose loan officers who are NHHFA-approved and experienced with down payment assistance programs.

**Jumbo loans:** Look for loan officers with portfolio lender relationships and Lake Region experience.

**Investment properties:** Find loan officers who understand rental income calculations and investor financing.

**Self-employed:** Choose loan officers experienced with business income documentation and tax return analysis.

### How to Compare Multiple Loan Officers
1. **Get 2–3 quotes** and compare Loan Estimates side-by-side
2. **Ask the same questions** to each loan officer for consistency
3. **Check reviews** on Google, Zillow, and local forums
4. **Evaluate communication style**—you'll work closely with them for 30–45 days

### Bottom Line
The best New Hampshire loan officer for you depends on your property type, program needs, and financial situation. Don't choose based on a single advertisement—interview at least two and compare their expertise, lender access, and communication quality.
