## NHHFA Programs and How New Hampshire Loan Officers Help You Qualify

New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority (NHHFA) programs offer **down payment assistance** and **below-market rates** for qualified first-time buyers. But navigating income limits, property caps, and application requirements can be complex.

### What NHHFA Offers
1. **Lower interest rates** (often 0.25%–0.50% below market)
2. **Down payment assistance** (up to $15,000 in some programs)
3. **Flexible credit requirements** (620+ accepted in many cases)
4. **First-time buyer and repeat buyer options**

### Income & Property Limits
NHHFA caps income by household size and county. Property price limits also vary:
- **Rockingham County** (Portsmouth area): Higher limits
- **Hillsborough County** (Manchester/Nashua): Mid-tier limits
- **Rural counties**: Often more flexible

### How NH Loan Officers Help
Qualified NHHFA loan officers:
- **Pre-check eligibility** before you search for homes
- **Explain which NHHFA program** fits your situation
- **Handle the application** and coordinate with NHHFA
- **Structure income documentation** to stay within limits

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Exceeding income limits:** Even $1 over disqualifies you
- **Wrong property type:** Condos and multi-family have different rules
- **Timing errors:** NHHFA funds run out; apply early in the year

### Bottom Line
NHHFA programs can save thousands on down payment and interest. But only **NHHFA-approved loan officers** can originate these loans. Choose one with experience navigating the program successfully.
