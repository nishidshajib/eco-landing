## Why New Hampshire Loan Officers Beat National Call Centers on Local Properties

National online lenders offer convenience and speed—until you hit a property that doesn't fit their automated underwriting. That's when **local New Hampshire loan officers** win.

### Where National Lenders Struggle in NH
1. **Seasonal homes:** Automated systems often reject Lake Region properties
2. **Portsmouth condos:** HOA reviews and condo rules trip up call center processors
3. **Investment properties:** National lenders use strict formulas that don't account for local rental markets
4. **Self-employment:** Cookie-cutter income calculations miss nuanced business structures

### Where NH Loan Officers Excel
Local loan officers understand:
- **Which appraisers** work fastest in your town
- **Which lenders** approve seasonal properties without hassle
- **Local rental rates** for investment property income calculations
- **NH market trends** that affect appraisal values

### Real Example
A Lake Winnipesaukee seasonal home buyer applied with a national lender:
- **National lender:** Automated decline (seasonal property, 75% CLTV)
- **NH loan officer:** Approved through portfolio lender (same property, 80% CLTV, better rate)

The loan officer knew which lender specializes in Lake Region properties and structured the application correctly.

### When to Choose National vs. Local
**Choose national lenders when:**
- Simple primary residence purchase
- Strong credit, standard employment
- Cookie-cutter property (suburban single-family)

**Choose NH loan officers when:**
- Seasonal or vacation home
- Investment or rental property
- Self-employed or complex income
- Condo with HOA complications
- First-time buyer using NHHFA programs

### Bottom Line
If your property or income situation is even slightly non-standard, **start with a New Hampshire loan officer**. They'll tell you if a national lender works—or they'll find a lender who actually approves your scenario.
