Our “term sheet lab” started as a Google Doc. We needed a place to compare DSCR, bank statement, and 1099 programs without losing track of who said what. Over time the doc evolved into a structured workflow with live calculators, escalation notes, and stakeholder-ready narratives. The format matters less than the discipline; when everyone reads from the same playbook, approvals arrive faster and negotiations feel calmer.

### Gather the raw ingredients

The lab opens with raw data: lender name, contact, timestamp, and documentation type. We stack the quotes vertically instead of side-by-side because it forces us to read each assumption slowly. Loan amount, amortization schedule, interest-only periods, prepay language, and reserve expectations appear under each lender’s header. By the time we finish typing, we already understand which quote deserves deeper analysis and which one misread the file from the start.

### Translate guidelines into plain English

Non-QM guidelines tend to be written for underwriters, not borrowers. We translate every requirement into conversational language so executives, spouses, and real estate partners can follow the logic. “12 months of bank statements” becomes “upload PDFs for the last year of deposits, no screenshots.” “3-2-1 prepay” becomes “there is a fee if you refinance within three years.” When stakeholders understand the constraints, they make faster decisions and ask better questions.

### Stress test the pricing

After translation, we stress test each quote. What happens if the borrower draws additional capital from the business? How sensitive is the pricing to loan-to-value or DSCR shifts? We use lightweight scenarios modeled after the calculators on Cash-OutRefinance.com to visualize the impact. Seeing the payment change on a chart is more persuasive than quoting basis points, especially for board members who think in budgets, not rate sheets.

### Document credit pacing

Every term sheet includes a section titled “Credit Timing,” borrowed from our work with MiddleCreditScore.com. We log upcoming statement dates, known balance drops, and any new trade lines on the horizon. If a lender requires a minimum credit score that feels tight, we outline the actions already scheduled to protect that tier. Lenders respond well because they see a plan, not just a hope that scores will stay high enough.

### Build the summary narrative

Once the data, translations, and stress tests are in place, we write a narrative that explains the recommendation. It reads like a short memo: macro backdrop, borrower objectives, what we like about the leading lender, and what risks we are monitoring. The memo calls out any open conditions so nobody signs off expecting a clear-to-close tomorrow. This narrative often becomes the email we send to lenders when we request clarifications or concessions.

### Share the lab with stakeholders

We publish the lab in three formats: PDF for quick reference, live doc for collaboration, and dashboard view inside our portal. Each format links back to the original receipts on BrowseLenders.com so anyone can verify the numbers. Because everything is cross-referenced, stakeholders rarely ask for additional spreadsheets; they just leave comments in the margin, and we reply with updated screenshots or clarifications.

### Capture lessons learned

At the end of every project we add a “Lessons” tab. Maybe a lender accelerated underwriting because we delivered RSU vesting schedules upfront. Maybe a pricing engine glitched when the LTV crossed 75 percent. These notes become the institutional memory that powers the next negotiating cycle. When a similar file appears months later, we already know which lender to call, what documentation to prep, and how long approvals will take.

### Keep it human

The lab works because it blends rigorous documentation with human context. Numbers alone rarely win arguments; stories do. When a borrower hears, “We recommend Lender B because they allow asset depletion, accept the bonus structure, and waive the prepay if you relocate again,” they feel seen. When a lender receives a recap that outlines every assumption, they feel respected. Transparency creates momentum.

If you do not have a term sheet lab yet, start small. Create a template, log the quotes, and translate the jargon. Over time you will find yourself copying sections directly into executive briefings, lender escalations, or compliance files. That reuse is the signal you built something valuable.
