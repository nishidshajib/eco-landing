Jumbo underwriting reviews are famous for derailing strong borrowers. Between reserve requirements, concentrated stock positions, and appraisal scrutiny, even well-paid households can feel shaky. My partner and I recently closed on a $2.8 million primary residence while juggling IPO lockups and relocation reimbursements. We promised ourselves the review would stay calm, so we reverse engineered the process into six checkpoints. Use our notes to shorten your own stress cycle.

## 1. Rebuild the financial narrative

We stopped thinking in terms of “documents” and started thinking in terms of chapters. Chapter one covered base salary, bonuses, and deferred comp. Chapter two summarized equity: RSUs, ESPP holdings, and privately held shares. Chapter three captured passive income from rentals and syndications. Each chapter opened with a one-page narrative that gave the underwriter context before they flipped through PDFs. The clarity alone removed three rounds of questions because our officer always had a cheat sheet.

## 2. Mirror the bank’s reserve math

High-balance lenders interpret reserves differently, so we mirrored their math in a spreadsheet. We listed every liquid account, brokerage account, and pledged asset, then tagged them with accessibility tiers: same-day, three-day, or ten-day transfer. We also noted which assets were subject to blackout windows. When the bank asked for twelve months of reserves, we could show exactly how many months each account covered even if the markets swung. They appreciated the transparency and never once challenged our numbers.

## 3. Script conversations about concentrated stock

Concentrated equity positions make committees nervous. Instead of waiting for questions, we wrote a script explaining the company prospects, blackout schedules, and hedging tools we already had in place. We included screenshots from our 10b5-1 plan and a letter from the brokerage desk confirming the ability to execute sales within 48 hours, outside of blackouts. Because the officer could paste that script directly into the credit memo, there was no speculation about whether we could free cash to cover the down payment or post-closing reserves.

## 4. Align appraisal expectations early

Luxury appraisals often struggle to find comps. We built a comp book ourselves with renovation receipts, listing photos from nearby estates, and notes from local agents explaining why view premiums mattered. We shared the book with the appraiser, listing agent, and our loan officer prior to inspection. When the report arrived slightly conservative, we already had the addendum ready, so the revision landed within 48 hours. The underwriter later admitted that the proactive package saved days of internal debate.

## 5. Run personal cash-flow stress tests

Even if you meet the ratios, you need to sleep at night. We modeled three “what if” scenarios: rate increases during a lock extension, delayed bonus payouts, and unexpected home repairs. For each scenario we listed the monthly impact and the mitigation plan. Sometimes the solution was as simple as pausing taxable investing for one quarter; other times it meant tapping a securities-backed line. We didn’t send every detail to the bank, but we shared the highlights so they knew we weren’t approaching the mortgage casually.

## 6. Hold weekly readiness stand-ups

Every Friday we held a 20-minute stand-up with our loan officer, real estate agent, and CPA. The agenda was boring on purpose: outstanding conditions, documents in-flight, upcoming deadlines, and risks. We tracked every item in a shared sheet that assigned an owner and due date. Even when people traveled, the sheet kept momentum because anyone could log in and see whether tax transcripts arrived or whether the condo questionnaire needed revisions. The meetings ended once the clear-to-close email hit our inbox, but by then everyone knew the cadence by heart.

## The payoff

Our file still demanded explanations and signatures, but nothing felt chaotic. The underwriter complimented the structure, our officer shaved days off the review, and we walked into signing feeling oddly relaxed. Jumbo mortgages may involve bigger numbers, yet the emotions are the same—people just want to feel heard, prepared, and respected. When you lead with a clean narrative and predictable touchpoints, even a seven-figure approval can feel downright quiet.
