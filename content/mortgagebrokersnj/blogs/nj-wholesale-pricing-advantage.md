## What Is Wholesale Mortgage Pricing?

Wholesale pricing is the rate sheet banks provide to mortgage brokers. It’s typically **0.25%–0.50% lower** than the rate a retail bank offers directly. Why? Wholesale lenders rely on brokers to bring them volume and reduce marketing costs, so they price more aggressively.

In New Jersey, this advantage is amplified because brokers can compare wholesale lenders against **local portfolio programs**—choosing the best combination of rate and approval flexibility.

## Example: Wholesale vs Retail Pricing

**Scenario:** $750K Bergen County purchase, 20% down

**Retail Bank:**
- Rate: 6.75%
- Origination fee: 1.0%
- APR: 6.92%

**Wholesale Broker:**
- Rate: 6.45%
- Origination fee: 0.75%
- APR: 6.58%

**Savings:** $165/month, $59,400 over 30 years

The wholesale broker wins not just on rate but also on total APR.

## Why Wholesale Pricing Is So Competitive

1. **Lower overhead**: Wholesale lenders don’t maintain retail branches
2. **Volume incentives**: Brokers bring consistent volume
3. **Less marketing expense**: Brokers do the lead generation
4. **Competitive pressure**: Multiple wholesale lenders compete for broker volume

This combination results in better rates for NJ borrowers.

## Wholesale Pricing + Portfolio Flexibility

NJ borrowers face unique challenges (2.49% property taxes, jumbo thresholds, condos). Brokers can compare wholesale lenders with **portfolio lenders** that allow 45%–50% DTI.

If wholesale pricing fails on DTI, portfolio lenders step in with flexible underwriting. This dual access is a major advantage of brokers in NJ.

## When Wholesale Pricing May Not Win

- If a bank offers relationship discounts (0.25%–0.50%)
- If you qualify for special employer programs
- If the bank offers a major closing cost credit

Even then, wholesale brokers should still be compared to verify total APR.

## How to Verify Wholesale Savings

Ask your broker for:
- At least 2–3 Loan Estimates
- Rate vs APR comparison
- Lender fee breakdown

Compare the APR, not just the advertised rate.

## The Bottom Line

Wholesale pricing gives NJ brokers a consistent advantage over retail banks—especially for Bergen, Essex, Morris, and Hudson borrowers facing jumbo or condo complexity. By combining wholesale pricing with portfolio flexibility, brokers often deliver the best balance of rate and approval probability.
