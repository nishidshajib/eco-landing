## The NJ Broker vs Bank Debate

New Jersey borrowers often ask whether banks or mortgage brokers deliver better pricing and approvals. The answer depends on your loan type, but in NJ’s high-cost, high-tax environment, brokers frequently outperform banks because they access **wholesale lenders** and **portfolio programs** that banks do not offer.

### Key Differences

**Banks:**
- Offer only their own lending programs
- Follow strict underwriting with limited flexibility
- Often conservative on high property-tax DTI
- May be slower due to internal processes

**Mortgage Brokers:**
- Access 10–20 wholesale lenders
- Can pivot if one lender declines
- Offer portfolio options with flexible DTI
- Compare rates and APR across multiple programs

## Rate Comparison Example (Bergen County)

**Scenario:** $900K purchase, 20% down, 30-year fixed

**Bank Quote:**
- Rate: 6.85%
- Origination fee: 1.0% ($9,000)
- APR: 7.02%

**Broker Wholesale Quote:**
- Rate: 6.55%
- Origination fee: 0.75% ($6,750)
- APR: 6.68%

**Savings:** $180/month and $64,800 over 30 years

This difference is typical because wholesale lenders price more aggressively than retail banks.

## Approval Flexibility: Property Tax DTI Challenge

NJ property taxes average 2.49%. Banks often cap DTI at 43% and decline borrowers who are otherwise strong. Brokers can access portfolio lenders who allow 45%–50% DTI.

**Example:** $1.2M Bergen County home
- Taxes: ~$2,500/month
- Bank DTI cap: 43% (decline)
- Portfolio lender: 48% DTI (approval)

Brokers provide options that banks can’t.

## Condo Financing: Hudson & Bergen

Banks often avoid condo projects with complex HOA budgets or low owner-occupancy. Brokers access condo-friendly lenders and portfolio programs for:
- Warrantable condos
- Non-warrantable condos
- Mixed-use buildings

If you’re buying in Hudson or Bergen, a broker often makes the difference between approval and denial.

## Jumbo Loans Above $806,550

Banks often price jumbo loans conservatively, while brokers compare multiple jumbo lenders. Wholesale jumbo pricing is typically **0.25%–0.50% lower** than retail banks.

## When a Bank Makes Sense

- Simple conventional loan under $806,550
- Strong W-2 income and low DTI
- Existing relationship and bank incentives

Even in these cases, compare a broker quote—you may still save money.

## The Bottom Line

In New Jersey, brokers win when:
- You need jumbo or portfolio financing
- Your DTI is compressed by property taxes
- You’re buying a condo or complex property
- You want multiple Loan Estimates to compare

Banks win only when the scenario is simple and relationship incentives are strong. For most NJ buyers, a broker comparison is essential.
