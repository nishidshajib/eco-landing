The fastest way to calm VA mortgage anxiety is to treat the first lender conversation like an intake briefing. You are the officer in command of your own file. The lender wants clear orders, not scattered uploads. Below is the same checklist we run through with coaching clients before they ever click "apply." Use it as a living document, revise it weekly, and share it with any spouse or co-borrower so the whole household rows in the same direction.

## 1. Confirm your service timeline and Certificate of Eligibility

The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is your entry badge. Pull it directly from VA.gov or ask your lender to request it through the WebLGY portal. Do not assume last year's copy is still valid—recent service, reserve points, or disability changes may not be reflected. Place the current COE, historical versions, and the request confirmation letter in a single PDF bundle. Add a readme that clarifies the branch, service dates, character of service, and remaining entitlement. When the underwriter opens your folder, they should see the full lineage without guesswork.

## 2. Lay out LES, pay history, and allowances like a story

Lenders care about income stability more than salary size. Gather the latest 60 days of LES statements and at least one quarter of pay summaries. Highlight BAH, BAS, COLA, flight pay, or hazard allowances that you count toward your housing plan. If pay will change because of PCS orders, promotions, or upcoming retirement, write a short narrative that explains the timeline and who can verify it. Attaching the narrative directly beneath the LES bundle saves the processor from hunting through emails later.

## 3. Build an orders and deployment appendix

Underwriters must document that you can occupy the property within 60 days, or that you have a power of attorney if you are deployed. Collect current PCS orders, deployment schedules, and any extensions or amendments. Add signed POA documents plus contact info for the designated representative. If your spouse or partner will occupy first, note that along with the expected move-in date. Include airline itineraries or base housing confirmations if they help tell the story. The goal is to remove any ambiguity around occupancy before the question is even asked.

## 4. Document disability benefits and funding fee expectations

VA funding fees shift depending on disability ratings, first-time use, and down payment size. Upload your latest VA disability award letter, even if you believe the lender already has it. In a one-page summary, outline whether you expect to pay the funding fee, waive it entirely, or roll it into the loan amount. If you qualify for a waiver but the system has not updated, note the date of your latest claim submission and keep screenshots ready. Giving the lender credible documentation up front prevents frantic emails a week before closing.

## 5. Organize assets and reserves with context

Even though VA loans allow zero down payment, underwriters still want to see reserves. Provide full PDF statements—not screenshots—for any checking, savings, or investment accounts you plan to leverage. Label each file with the institution, last four digits, and purpose (earnest money, reserves, closing costs). Large deposits need sourcing, so add letters of explanation or gift letters the day the funds hit your account. When assets are organized chronologically, the lender can trace them in minutes instead of escalating to a manual review.

## 6. Track debts, childcare costs, and subscription creep

Residual income tests feel harsh only when you learn about them during underwriting. List every recurring obligation: auto loans, student loans, credit cards, childcare, elder care, even monthly subscription services. Include balance, monthly payment, and whether any account will be paid off before closing. This list helps the loan officer map your residual income by region and household size without repeatedly calling you. It also surfaces opportunities to pay down nuisance debts that clog the debt-to-income ratio.

## 7. Prepare your reference roster

Lenders routinely verify employment, but VA files often trigger additional calls to commanding officers or HR teams. Create a simple roster that includes name, title, preferred contact method, and availability. Brief each person ahead of time so they know to expect the lender. Add the roster to your shared drive so your agent can reference it when crafting offer timelines. A ready-made contact sheet keeps the process respectful of everyone's time zones and watch schedules.

## 8. Build a condition tracker before conditional approval arrives

Think of the condition tracker as your mission log. Use a spreadsheet or project management board with columns for request, owner, due date, and status. The moment a processor asks for an updated LES, proof of earnest money deposit, or clarification on an allowance, add it to the tracker. Share the link with your spouse, lender, and agent so they can see progress in real time. Military life runs on briefings—your VA mortgage deserves the same discipline.

## 9. Share the folder structure with your team

Once the documentation is in place, walk your agent and lender through the folder hierarchy. Point out where the COE lives, where LES statements are stored, and how you label updated versions. Invite them to comment directly inside the folders so feedback stays near the documents instead of getting buried in long email threads. This transparency reduces duplicate requests and shows that you operate like a pro.

## The briefing evolves with you

Orders change, allowances adjust, and life happens. Treat this checklist as a rolling briefing, not a one-time upload sprint. Schedule a weekly 30-minute session—alone or with family—to review what changed and what needs refreshing. When you finally make an offer, you will spend your energy negotiating inspection repairs instead of digging through storage bins for paperwork. That confidence is what every VA buyer deserves.
