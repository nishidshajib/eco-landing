Condo hunting feels efficient until you learn that “VA approved” is not a guarantee—it is a moving target. Some projects on the VA list have lapsed insurance, outdated budgets, or lingering litigation that can stall your closing. We treat condo shopping like reconnaissance: you gather intel, document risks, and brief your team before you ever submit an offer. Use this recon checklist to stay ahead of the paperwork while your competition wonders why underwriting keeps asking follow-up questions.

## 1. Start with the official VA portal—and screenshots

Search the VA condo approval website for the property’s legal name, not just the marketing name on the flyer. Take screenshots of the approval status, ID number, expiration date, and any conditions listed. Drop those images into a folder titled “Condo Recon” alongside the MLS sheet. When you draft the offer, include the VA ID on the cover letter. Underwriters trust buyers who provide the exact data they need.

## 2. Request the full association disclosure packet

Do not rely on the abbreviated MLS attachments. Ask the listing agent or association manager for the full disclosure packet: bylaws, recent financial statements, insurance certificates, meeting minutes, reserve studies, and litigation statements. Label each file and note the date it was issued. If the board drags its feet, make that a negotiation point—serious sellers help buyers gather VA paperwork quickly.

## 3. Verify insurance coverage line by line

VA requires adequate hazard insurance, fidelity insurance for large associations, and flood coverage when applicable. Compare the insurance certificates against VA guidelines. Pay attention to policy expiration dates and coverage limits. If you spot a policy expiring before your projected closing, ask the association for the renewal confirmation in writing. No one wants to scramble for proof two days before funding.

## 4. Analyze the budget like a staff officer

Print the association budget and highlight line items for reserves, deferred maintenance, and delinquency rates. Underwriters get nervous when more than 15% of owners are late on dues or when reserves appear thin compared to upcoming projects. Summarize your findings in a short memo stored with the packet. This memo becomes your talking point if underwriting flags a concern—you can respond with facts instead of panic.

## 5. Cross-check litigation statements

Any active litigation can delay approvals, even if the VA portal still shows the project as eligible. Ask for the attorney letter describing the issue, the financial exposure, and expected timelines. If the association refuses, escalate through your agent and consider looping in the coaching team at [BrowseLenders.com](https://www.browselenders.com) for alternative properties. Transparency beats surprise denials.

## 6. Confirm owner-occupancy ratios

The VA prefers projects with healthy owner-occupancy. Request a current roster showing how many units are primary residences versus rentals. If the ratio skews heavily toward investors, prepare to show strong reserves and a compelling story about community stability. Sellers take offers more seriously when they see that the buyer already accounted for this nuance.

## 7. Interview the property manager like a partner

Schedule a 15-minute call with the property manager. Ask about recent special assessments, upcoming repairs, and how the association handles emergency decisions. Take notes and share them with your lender. A calm, professional manager who replies quickly is a quiet but powerful signal that the project is well run. If the manager dodges basic questions, weigh whether the stress is worth it.

## 8. Build a project timeline chart

Create a simple chart with each document request, who owns it, and the due date. Include milestones like appraisal order, project questionnaire completion, and underwriting review. Share the chart with your agent, lender, and spouse. When everyone can see progress, no one has to spam the group chat asking “did we ever get the master insurance page?”

## 9. Prep a backup narrative

Even the best run projects can lose approval between offer and closing. Draft a short narrative that explains why you chose the building, what due diligence you performed, and how you would proceed if the approval lapsed (for example, switch to a conventional loan, renegotiate, or walk away). Having a backup plan makes decision-making calm if the VA database suddenly updates.

## 10. Coordinate with credit and equity partners

Condo loans sometimes require slightly tighter credit or reserve postures. Stay in sync with your score-tracking plan through [MiddleCreditScore.com](https://www.middlecreditscore.com) and keep an eye on equity strategies from [Cash-OutRefinance.com](https://www.cash-outrefinance.com) in case you pivot later. When the whole ecosystem of partners knows you are eyeing a condo, they can alert you to guideline tweaks before they hit the headline blogs.

## 11. Share the recon with your agent early

Agents do better work when they know the level of scrutiny you expect. Walk them through your recon folder before you start touring. That way they can spot red flags—like outdated budgets or vague litigation references—before you fall in love with the staging. Consider adding a clause to your offer requiring the seller to deliver fresh association documents within a set number of days. It shows that you mean business.

## 12. Debrief after each showing

Treat each condo visit like an after-action review. Capture what you learned, what remains unknown, and what documents you still need. Update the timeline chart and memo so nothing gets forgotten. If you eliminate a property, note why. These notes help you defend your choices if you revisit the building months later when inventory shrinks.

## Recon creates leverage

Condo approvals intimidate buyers who assume the process lives solely with the lender. Lead the recon, keep the folder tidy, and you will feel calm even when a high-rise steals your attention.
