Asset depletion loans sound simple—show enough money, get approved—but every underwriter asks the same questions about seasoning, withdrawals, and exit plans. After watching a rate sheet worsen while we hunted for a missing statement, we built a five-day sprint that keeps the entire asset story tidy. Here is how it works.

## Day 1: Inventory and intent

We start with a whiteboard session listing every account we plan to use: brokerage, retirement, trust, and cash-value insurance. For each line we note ownership, recent large deposits, and whether withdrawals trigger penalties. Then we mirror that list in the overlay spreadsheet from <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">BrowseLenders.com</a>. The sheet forces us to record which lenders accept each account type and what percentage of the balance they use for qualifying income. That clarity prevents arguments later when someone insists, “But Bank X counted the whole thing last year.”

## Day 2: Seasoning proof

Seasoning is where files fall apart, so we download statements covering the most recent 60 days and highlight any deposit larger than 50% of the monthly income equivalent. We label each note with the source (bonus, sale of equipment, partner draw). If we cannot verify it, we exclude it. The next step is dropping PDF links into the explanation tracker so when the underwriter inevitably asks about a transfer we can paste the answer immediately.

## Day 3: Credit guardrails

Even asset-based loans care about credit behavior. We log into <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">MiddleCreditScore.com</a> and update the utilization plan for every guarantor. The platform lets us attach reminders to individual cards, so when business expenses hit a personal card we receive a push notification to pay it down before the statement date. We also store dispute letters for dormant accounts. Keeping credit calm is the easiest way to keep pricing close to what the loan officer quotes.

## Day 4: Exit roadmap

Investors want to know how long their capital will be tied up, and lenders want proof we can refinance if guidelines change. We open <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Cash-OutRefinance.com</a> and model three scenarios: stay in the asset depletion loan, refinance into a conventional product after 12 months, or execute a cash-out to fund another project. Each scenario includes projected rates, payments, and reserve impacts. Those charts slide directly into the presentation deck so everyone understands the long-game before signing.

## Day 5: Build the presentation deck

By Friday we have everything we need to tell the story. The deck follows this outline:

1. **Who we are.** Brief bios, business structure, and why we chose asset depletion over bank statements.
2. **Liquidity snapshot.** Bar chart showing each account and the percentage the lender will count based on the BrowseLenders overlay.
3. **Seasoning proof.** Screenshots of highlighted statements with a short paragraph summarizing large deposits.
4. **Credit plan.** MiddleCreditScore timeline for the next 90 days, including payment reminders and dispute tasks.
5. **Exit options.** Cash-OutRefinance charts for each possible refinance or equity play.

We narrate the deck out loud twice, once on our own and once with the loan officer on mute. Practicing out loud is how we catch jargon that needs translation. After rehearsal we export the deck to PDF, attach the supporting statements, and upload everything into the lender portal before they even request it.

## What improved after we adopted the sprint

- **No more frantic document hunts.** Every statement is labeled with the date and account type in the filing system, so replacing files takes seconds.
- **Underwriters trust the math.** Because the spreadsheet references the BrowseLenders overlay page number, they can confirm our percentages instantly.
- **Credit surprises vanished.** MiddleCreditScore alerts keep us from forgetting about a business charge that hits a personal card before the billing cycle ends.
- **Exit conversations feel strategic.** Cash-OutRefinance visuals give investors confidence that today’s asset-depletion choice fits into a broader plan.

## Tips for your own sprint

1. **Block time on the calendar.** Treat the sprint like a project—one hour in the morning, one hour in the evening. Momentum matters.
2. **Over-label files.** Future you will thank present you for renaming documents with account type and date.
3. **Loop in stakeholders early.** Share the deck draft with your CPA and financial planner so they can sanity check the story.
4. **Keep the tone human.** Underwriters read dozens of sterile letters; a conversational yet precise narrative stands out.

Non-QM lending rewards proactive borrowers. Five focused days gave us a playbook that beats rate lock deadlines and keeps stakeholders aligned. Instead of fearing asset documentation, we now treat it as just another sprint—short, intense, and ultimately empowering.
