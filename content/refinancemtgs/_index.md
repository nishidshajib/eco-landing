RefinanceMTGs.com started as the checklist we used to compare rate sheets for parents, siblings, and a rotating cast of military friends. We traced every lender overlay, payment scenario, and equity objective in one workspace so no one felt pressured into locking before the math made sense.

Today that workspace is public. You can plug in the same prompts we used—current payment, desired payment, debt that must disappear, equity that must stay—and receive the refinance brief that kept our group organized. We highlight where rate-and-term makes sense, when a cash-out plug solves bigger problems, and how to document each dollar so underwriters stay comfortable.

All of the guides have a conversational tone because they were written during kitchen-table planning sessions. Use them with your financial advisor, send them to a co-borrower, or repurpose the scripts for your favorite lender. The point is to make refinance planning less mysterious and way more collaborative.
