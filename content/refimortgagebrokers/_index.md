Shopping refinance rates yourself means calling multiple banks, repeating your information endlessly, and comparing confusing quotes that hide fees in fine print. Mortgage brokers eliminate this hassle by shopping your scenario across 20+ wholesale lenders simultaneously and delivering transparent rate comparisons.

These brokers leverage lender relationships and volume to negotiate rates that beat what you would get going direct—often by 0.125-0.375% in rate or thousands in fees.
