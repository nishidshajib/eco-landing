The most stressful part of my FHA 203(k) rehab wasn’t demolition or framing—it was the final 30 days, when every punch-list item mattered and the final draw dangled over our heads. I wrote a “Punch-List Week Checklist” to keep myself sane. Instead of guessing what to do each day, I followed this cadence and shared it with my contractor, HUD consultant, and loan officer. We hit every inspection on plan, kept the budget balanced, and unlocked the last disbursement without scrambling.

## Week 1: Inventory everything

**Day 1:** Walk each room with blue painter’s tape and tag every imperfection. I separated items into three buckets: critical fixes (code or safety), cosmetic touch-ups, and owner-upgrades I would handle after closeout.

**Day 2:** Upload the list into the FHA203KMortgages.com tracker and assign owners. The contractor got structural, our painter got finish work, and I claimed DIY punch items.

**Day 3:** Pull receipts and warranties. I scanned appliance serial numbers, fixture SKUs, and subcontractor invoices into a single PDF folder. Future buyers—or refinance underwriters—love seeing that file.

**Day 4:** Sync with the HUD consultant. We reviewed which items required another inspection and which could be photo-verified. This prevented surprise visits that might have delayed the timeline.

**Day 5:** Update the lender. I emailed a status snapshot with three bullets: outstanding critical fixes, anticipated inspection date, and current draw balance. Because the lender already had context, they didn’t flood us with mid-week questions.

## Week 2: Focus on inspectors

**Day 8:** Confirm permits and inspection windows. Some jurisdictions need three-day notice, so we scheduled everything early.

**Day 9:** Stage the house for inspection photos. No loose tools, no debris, clear access to panels and shutoffs. Inspectors may be rushed—make their job easy.

**Day 10:** Hold a pre-inspection huddle. Contractor, consultant, and I reviewed the checklist, rehearsed answers, and assigned who would speak to which item. Think of it as a sales pitch for your finished work.

**Day 11:** Inspection day. I brought printed copies of the draw schedule, receipts, and the punch-list tracker. When inspectors asked why a change order shifted tile placement, I could show the documented approval.

**Day 12:** Debrief call. We logged inspector feedback inside the portal, tagged responsible trades, and attached completion photos. Keeping everything centralized meant the underwriter could verify progress without waiting for a separate email chain.

## Week 3: Budget reality check

**Day 15:** Compare actual versus budget line items. Any savings rolled into a contingency reserve; overruns triggered a faster change-order review.

**Day 16:** Audit credit usage on <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">MiddleCreditScore.com</a>. I ensured every supplier charge reported under 30% utilization before the lender pulled final credit.

**Day 17:** Reconcile retainage. Our contractor held 10% per trade until final acceptance. We confirmed outstanding amounts and locked in release dates.

**Day 18:** Send lender-ready packet. It included inspection sign-offs, lien waivers, and proof of paid invoices. I also attached screenshots from <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">BrowseLenders.com</a> to show projected equity based on nearby comps.

**Day 19:** Verify insurance transitions. We made sure the builder’s risk policy would convert to a standard homeowner’s policy the moment the lender issued the final draw.

## Week 4: Hand-off and future-proofing

**Day 22:** Host a homeowner orientation with the contractor. We walked through shutoffs, maintenance schedules, and smart device resets. Everything was recorded and stored in the portal.

**Day 23:** Final cleaning and staging photos. I hired a cleaning crew and snapped magazine-worthy images. These photos later powered rental listings and refinance packages on <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Cash-OutRefinance.com</a>.

**Day 24:** Submit the final draw request. Because all documents were pre-organized, the lender approved within 36 hours.

**Day 25:** Celebrate, then document lessons learned. I wrote a one-page retrospective highlighting what went well and what I would change. Future me—and future buyers—will thank me.

**Day 26:** Transition into warranty mode. We set calendar reminders for seasonal maintenance, filter changes, and follow-up inspections. I also kept a running log of contractor response times in case warranty claims arise.

## Why the checklist works

- **It aligns everyone.** Contractors know exactly which day they’re on the hook for, consultants see progress in writing, and lenders trust the cadence.
- **It enforces documentation.** Photos, receipts, inspection notes, and lien waivers live in one folder instead of scattered inboxes.
- **It keeps the big picture in view.** You’re not just finishing drywall—you’re prepping the property for years of financing options.

Punch-list weeks will always be intense, but structure calms the chaos. Copy this plan, adapt the dates to your rehab, and keep your support team looped in. The final stretch is where projects either coast smoothly into conventional financing or stumble into costly delays. Choose smooth.
