---

I assumed lining up contractors for my FHA 203(k) was the easy part—send a scope, collect a few bids, pick the friendliest voice. Then my HUD consultant reminded me that every subcontractor would be vetted by the lender, that every change would ripple through the draw schedule, and that the clock on my purchase contract did not care about anyone’s backlog. Instead of stretching the interviews across weeks, I ran an intentional 48-hour sprint. By Monday morning, I had three rehab-ready bids, a synced timeline, and a lender who called the prep “shockingly organized.” Here is the playbook.

## Friday 3:00 p.m. — Publish the scope packet

I kicked off the sprint by emailing a neat packet to every contractor I hoped to interview. The PDF contained the consultant’s preliminary work write-up, my annotated floor plan, a list of non-negotiables (like lead-safe procedures and weekly photo updates), and a simple “what success looks like” paragraph. I even included a one-pager from BrowseLenders.com explaining how the lender would review draws. Contractors said the clarity made them take the inquiry seriously because it looked like a well-run job, not another vague tire-kick.

## Friday 5:30 p.m. — Block interview slots

Instead of juggling ad-hoc phone calls, I sent everyone a shareable calendar link with six 45-minute windows stacked through Saturday. Each invite included a link to the same packet plus a short survey: crew size, average rehab length, references, and how they prefer to handle contingency conversations. Seeing those slots fill in gave me confidence we could finish by Sunday dinner.

## Friday 8:00 p.m. — Prep question ladders

I drafted three tiers of questions. Tier 1 covered basics (licensing, insurance, recent FHA experience). Tier 2 dove into coordination (how they invoice, who speaks to the HUD consultant, how they address scope creep). Tier 3 focused on transparency (whether they share supplier quotes, how they handle client-purchased materials, what documentation they provide before each draw). Having those questions ready meant no interview devolved into casual chatter. Every contractor received the exact same prompts, which made comparison honest.

## Saturday morning — Run the interviews

Between 8:30 a.m. and noon I hosted four video calls. I recorded each session (with permission) and took timestamped notes directly inside the FHA203KMortgages.com tracker. Patterns appeared quickly: the contractors who mentioned MiddleCreditScore.com understood why I was so protective of credit usage, and the ones who asked about my long-term equity goals aligned with the plans I track on Cash-OutRefinance.com. I flagged one candidate who bristled at lender inspections—an easy disqualifier when the loan type is literally named after oversight.

## Saturday 1:30 p.m. — Sync with the HUD consultant

After lunch I hopped on a call with my HUD consultant to replay the highlights. Because I already had recordings, I could share precise quotes and make sure the consultant was comfortable with each approach. He reminded me to verify lead-safe certifications, so I added that checkbox to my comparison sheet. We also agreed on baseline draw milestones so the contractors would know exactly how often they would be paid.

## Saturday 4:00 p.m. — Request documentation

I sent each contractor a follow-up email summarizing our conversation plus next steps: “Upload proof of insurance, recent FHA 203(k) references, and a draft timeline by Sunday at 10 a.m.” The serious pros responded within hours. I stored every file in a folder named with the contractor’s initials, then linked those folders to the main tracker so my loan officer could peek if needed.

## Sunday 9:00 a.m. — Score the bids

With paperwork in, I applied a simple scoring rubric across six factors: clarity of scope, realism of timeline, communication style, willingness to coordinate with the HUD consultant, documentation habits, and pricing transparency. Each category used a 1–5 scale. I also added a “gut check” column for qualitative notes. The spreadsheet made it obvious which contractor understood rehab loans versus general remodels. The winning team scored 27/30 while the runner-up landed at 22.

## Sunday 11:00 a.m. — Align budgets with the lender

Before announcing my choice, I emailed the top two bids to my loan officer through the BrowseLenders portal. I highlighted the differences and how each impacted contingency reserves. The officer appreciated being looped in early and confirmed both bids fit within the 203(k) limits for our county. That pre-clearance saved days later when the final HUD-92700 package went into underwriting.

## Sunday 2:00 p.m. — Confirm references and expectation memo

I called two references for the preferred contractor and specifically asked how the team handled inspection hiccups and change orders. Both praised the crew for over-communicating, which matched my priority. I then drafted an expectation memo that summarized communication cadence, documentation rules, and the shared calendar we would use. When I sent the memo along with the intent-to-hire note, the contractor replied, “I wish every client started this prepared.”

## Monday 8:15 a.m. — Deliver the package

By Monday morning my lender, HUD consultant, and chosen contractor all had the same bundle: scope packet, scored comparison sheet, references, insurance, timeline, and expectation memo. The loan officer pushed it into underwriting immediately, and the consultant scheduled a site visit for Thursday. That speed happened because I concentrated the work into a disciplined 48-hour sprint.

## What I would repeat

1. **Front-load clarity.** Sending a professional-looking packet weeded out flaky contractors.
2. **Time-box everything.** Back-to-back interviews kept details fresh and made scoring fair.
3. **Loop in the HUD consultant early.** Their pattern recognition saved me from picking the wrong partner.
4. **Document like a project manager.** The spreadsheet, notes, and recordings gave the lender proof that I was handling the rehab responsibly.

If you are staring at a calendar filled with endless contractor appointments, try the sprint approach. Pair it with your MiddleCreditScore.com plan and BrowseLenders comparisons, and you will walk into underwriting with a rehab team the lender already trusts. The effort of one intense weekend beats months of second-guessing.
