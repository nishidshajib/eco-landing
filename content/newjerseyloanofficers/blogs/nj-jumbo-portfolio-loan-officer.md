## NJ Jumbo Financing Starts Above $806,550

New Jersey’s conforming loan limit is **$806,550**. Any loan above this threshold requires **jumbo or portfolio financing**, which comes with different underwriting rules, documentation requirements, and pricing structures. The right loan officer can mean the difference between approval and denial—or between a competitive rate and a costly premium.

## Jumbo vs Portfolio: Key Differences

### Jumbo (Agency-Style)
- Follows stricter underwriting guidelines
- Typically caps DTI at 43%
- Requires 12 months of reserves
- Best for strong W-2 income and 740+ credit

### Portfolio Jumbo
- Underwritten by banks with their own guidelines
- DTI flexibility: 45%–50% common
- Asset-based or cash-flow underwriting possible
- Better for self-employed, complex income, or high property tax burdens

## What a Jumbo Loan Officer Should Do

A qualified NJ jumbo loan officer should:

- Explain conforming vs jumbo pricing clearly
- Compare multiple jumbo lenders (not just one)
- Provide scenarios at 10%, 20%, and 30% down
- Calculate actual DTI using NJ property taxes
- Advise on reserves, asset-based options, and documentation strategy

If a loan officer only quotes one lender or can’t explain DTI impact, keep searching.

## County-Specific Jumbo Expertise

### Bergen County
- High competition for jumbo borrowers
- Most lenders active, best pricing availability
- Ask loan officer about lenders for $1M–$2M ranges

### Essex County
- Luxury properties and complex income common
- Portfolio lenders often better than agency jumbo
- Ask for experience with estate properties and appraisal challenges

### Morris County
- Estates and acreage frequently require portfolio underwriting
- Loan officers should manage appraisal and title complexity
- Ask about lender relationships for $2M+ loans

### Hudson County
- Condos and urban properties dominate
- Loan officer must manage condo approval and HOA reviews
- Ask how they handle condo eligibility for jumbo loans

## DTI: The NJ Property Tax Problem

New Jersey property taxes average 2.49%, which significantly impacts DTI. A $1M home often adds $2,083/month in taxes. That means:

- DTI gets compressed quickly
- Agency jumbo lenders may decline at 43% DTI
- Portfolio lenders at 45%–50% DTI become essential

A good loan officer will explain this early and offer portfolio alternatives instead of letting the application fail at underwriting.

## Reserve Requirements and Asset Strategy

Jumbo loans typically require 6–12 months of reserves. Portfolio lenders may require 12–24 months for complex scenarios. A strong loan officer will:

- Show how reserves are calculated
- Clarify eligible asset types (checking, brokerage, retirement)
- Suggest asset-based underwriting if income is complex

## Rate Premiums to Expect

Jumbo and portfolio loans usually carry modest premiums:
- Jumbo: 0.25%–0.50% above conforming
- Portfolio: 0.25%–0.75% above jumbo, depending on complexity

The right loan officer minimizes these premiums by matching you to the best lender for your profile.

## Questions to Ask a Jumbo Loan Officer

1. Which lenders do you use for jumbo loans above $806,550?
2. Do you have portfolio options for high DTI or self-employed borrowers?
3. How do you calculate NJ property tax in DTI?
4. What reserve requirements should I expect?
5. Can you provide rate and APR comparisons across at least 3 lenders?

## The Bottom Line

Jumbo financing in New Jersey requires specialized knowledge, county expertise, and access to portfolio lenders. The right loan officer will provide multiple lender options, explain DTI and reserve requirements clearly, and tailor your loan structure to NJ’s high-tax environment.
