When I found a 1992 colonial for $218,000, I knew it needed work.

**The problems:**
- Kitchen: Original oak cabinets (dark, dated), laminate countertops (chipped), old appliances
- Bathroom: Almond-colored fixtures (why was this ever a thing?), cracked tile, builder-grade vanity
- Flooring: Worn carpet throughout (stained, pet odors)
- Paint: Yellowed walls, patched holes from previous owner's decor

**The good news:** No structural issues. Roof was 8 years old. HVAC was 6 years old. Foundation was solid.

**Translation:** I needed **cosmetic updates only**—no big-ticket structural repairs.

**My contractor's estimate:** $28,500 total

**My loan officer's recommendation:** "You can use **Limited FHA 203(k)**—simpler process, faster closing, no HUD consultant required."

**I'd never heard of Limited FHA 203(k).**

**What I learned:** It's the **faster, simpler cousin** of Standard FHA 203(k)—perfect for cosmetic renovations under $35,000.

**My experience:**
- Closed in **38 days** (vs. 75-90 days for Standard 203(k))
- Paid **$0 for HUD consultant** (saved $1,200-$1,500)
- Only **2 draws** instead of 5+ (simpler payment process)
- Moved into my updated home **6 weeks faster** than friends who used Standard 203(k)

Here's how Limited FHA 203(k) works, what repairs are allowed, and why it's the best-kept secret for cosmetic fixer-uppers.

## What Is Limited FHA 203(k)?

### The Basics

**Loan type:** FHA-insured loan that combines purchase price + renovation costs into one mortgage

**Renovation limit:** Up to **$35,000** in total repair costs

**Allowed work:** **Cosmetic repairs only** (no structural work, no major system replacements)

**Down payment:** 3.5% of total loan (same as standard FHA)

**Credit requirement:** 620+ for 3.5% down (580-619 requires 10% down)

**HUD consultant:** **Not required** (this is the big time-saver)

### How It's Different from Standard FHA 203(k)

| Feature | Limited 203(k) | Standard 203(k) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Renovation cap** | Up to $35,000 | Unlimited |
| **Allowed work** | Cosmetic only | Structural + cosmetic |
| **HUD consultant** | Not required | Required ($800-$1,500 fee) |
| **Draws** | 1-2 payments | 4-6+ payments |
| **Closing timeline** | 30-45 days | 60-90 days |
| **Credit score** | 620+ for 3.5% down | 640+ for 3.5% down |
| **Best for** | Cosmetic updates | Major renovations |

### Why Limited FHA 203(k) Exists

**The problem it solves:** Many first-time buyers find houses that are **livable but outdated**—they don't need foundation work or a new roof, just cosmetic improvements to make the home modern and move-in ready.

**Standard FHA 203(k) was overkill** for these buyers—too slow, too complicated, too expensive (HUD consultant fees).

**Limited FHA 203(k) streamlines the process** for cosmetic-only renovations, allowing buyers to:
- Close faster (30-45 days vs. 60-90)
- Save money (no HUD consultant fee)
- Simplify payments (1-2 draws instead of 5+)

**Perfect for:** Kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, paint, appliances—the cosmetic updates that make a house feel like home.

## My Limited FHA 203(k) Closing Process (38 Days Total)

### Day 1: Offer Accepted

**Purchase price:** $218,000  
**Estimated renovation:** $28,500  
**Total loan amount:** $246,500 (+ closing costs financed)

**Financing details:**
- 3.5% down payment on total loan: $8,628
- Closing costs: ~$6,200
- Total cash needed: ~$14,828

**I submitted my offer with FHA 203(k) financing contingency** (gave me 38 days to close).

### Days 2-5: Finding a Contractor

**Unlike Standard 203(k), I didn't need a HUD-approved consultant**—I just needed a licensed contractor willing to work with the draw schedule.

**I called 8 contractors:**
- 5 agreed to bid (Limited 203(k) is much simpler than Standard—fewer contractors refuse)
- 3 declined (already booked)

**I got 3 bids:**
- **Bid #1:** $31,200 (detailed, experienced with FHA loans)
- **Bid #2:** $28,500 (moderate experience, good reviews)
- **Bid #3:** $26,800 (low experience, vague bid)

**I chose Bid #2** ($28,500—moderate experience, detailed bid, reasonable price).

### Days 6-10: Submitting Contractor Bids to Lender

**For Limited 203(k), you need:**
- Contractor's bid (detailed line-item breakdown)
- Contractor's license and insurance
- Feasibility study (simple form describing repairs—lender provides template)

**I submitted:**
- Contractor's 9-page bid with photos and material specs
- Contractor's license (verified online—active, no complaints)
- Contractor's insurance certificate
- Feasibility study (I filled this out with contractor's help—took 30 minutes)

**Lender reviewed in 4 days** and approved the renovation scope.

### Days 11-28: Loan Underwriting

**Underwriting for Limited 203(k) is simpler than Standard 203(k):**
- No HUD consultant review (saves 1-2 weeks)
- No work write-up creation (saves 1 week)
- Fewer documents to review

**My underwriting timeline:**
- Days 11-15: Initial underwriting review (verified income, credit, assets)
- Days 16-20: Appraisal ordered and completed (property appraised "as-is" + "as-completed" value)
- Days 21-25: Final underwriting conditions (submitted missing paystub, bank statement)
- Days 26-28: Clear to close

**Total underwriting: 18 days** (vs. 30-45 days for Standard 203(k))

### Day 29-38: Closing and Renovation Start

**Day 29:** Final walkthrough (property condition unchanged)  
**Day 30:** Closing (signed docs, keys handed over)  
**Day 31:** Contractor started work

**Renovation timeline:** 42 days (faster than Standard 203(k) because only 2 draws—less inspection delay)

## Limited FHA 203(k) Draw Process (Simpler Than Standard)

### Draw Structure

**Limited 203(k) allows only 1-2 draws:**

**Option #1 (what I used):** 50/50 draw structure
- **Draw #1:** 50% of renovation funds when work is 50% complete
- **Draw #2:** Remaining 50% when all work is 100% complete

**Option #2:** Single draw
- **Draw #1:** 100% of renovation funds when all work is 100% complete

**I chose Option #1** (50/50) because my contractor needed materials payment at midpoint.

### My Draw #1: 50% Complete

**Timeline:** Day 21 of renovation (3 weeks in)

**Work completed:**
- Kitchen cabinets painted and hardware replaced
- Bathroom vanity installed, toilet replaced
- Flooring installed in living room and hallway (50% of total)

**Contractor submitted:**
- Photos of completed work (47 photos)
- Invoices for materials (cabinets, vanity, toilet, flooring—$9,800 total)
- Draw request form (lender provided template)

**Lender's inspector came out** (not a HUD consultant—just a regular FHA appraiser) to verify work was complete.

**Inspector's report:** "Work matches feasibility study. 50% complete confirmed."

**Funds released:** $14,250 (50% of $28,500) within 5 business days.

**Total delay:** 7 days from draw request to funds received (vs. 10-14 days for Standard 203(k) with HUD consultant review).

### My Draw #2: 100% Complete

**Timeline:** Day 42 of renovation (6 weeks in)

**Work completed:**
- Kitchen countertops, backsplash, appliances installed
- Bathroom tile, fixtures, mirror installed
- Flooring completed (remaining 50%)
- Whole-house paint finished

**Contractor submitted:**
- Final photos (83 photos total)
- Final invoices (countertops, appliances, tile, fixtures, paint—$14,250 total)
- Final draw request

**Lender's inspector came out again** to verify 100% completion.

**Inspector's report:** "All work complete per feasibility study. Property meets FHA minimum standards."

**Funds released:** $14,250 (remaining 50%) within 5 business days.

**Total project timeline:** 42 days from start to finish.

## What Repairs Are Allowed with Limited FHA 203(k)?

### Cosmetic Repairs (Allowed)

✅ **Kitchen/bathroom remodels** (cabinets, countertops, fixtures, tile—no structural changes)  
✅ **Flooring** (carpet, hardwood, tile, vinyl—no subfloor replacement)  
✅ **Painting** (interior/exterior)  
✅ **Appliances** (refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, washer/dryer)  
✅ **New carpet, tile, or vinyl flooring** (no structural floor repair)  
✅ **Minor repairs** (patch drywall holes, replace broken tiles, fix leaky faucets)  
✅ **Landscaping** (new sod, trees, bushes)  
✅ **Accessibility** (ramps, grab bars, wider doorways)  
✅ **Energy efficiency** (new windows, insulation, programmable thermostats)  
✅ **Minor plumbing/electrical** (replace fixtures, outlets, light switches—no rewiring or repiping)

### Structural/Major Repairs (NOT Allowed)

❌ **Structural work** (foundation repair, framing, load-bearing wall removal)  
❌ **Roof replacement** (full tear-off and replacement—minor repairs OK)  
❌ **HVAC replacement** (full system replacement—repairs OK)  
❌ **Plumbing system replacement** (repiping, sewer line replacement—fixture replacement OK)  
❌ **Electrical panel upgrade** (100-amp to 200-amp—outlet/switch replacement OK)  
❌ **Additions** (adding rooms, garages, decks over 200 sq ft)  
❌ **Major subfloor repair or replacement**

### The $35,000 Cap

**Important:** Your total renovation budget (including contingency) must stay under $35,000.

**My budget:** $28,500 + $2,850 contingency (10%) = $31,350 total (under cap by $3,650).

**What happens if you go over $35,000?** You have to use **Standard FHA 203(k)** instead (which requires HUD consultant, longer closing, more complexity).

## Why I'm Glad I Used Limited FHA 203(k) (Instead of Standard)

### Reason #1: Saved $1,200-$1,500 on HUD Consultant

**Standard 203(k) requirement:** HUD consultant fee ($1,200-$1,500 for a $28,500 renovation)

**Limited 203(k) requirement:** No HUD consultant

**Savings:** $1,200-$1,500

**What I did with the savings:** Put it toward higher-quality quartz countertops (upgraded from laminate).

### Reason #2: Closed 37 Days Faster

**Standard 203(k) timeline:** 75-90 days from offer to close

**Limited 203(k) timeline:** 38 days from offer to close

**Difference:** 37-52 days faster

**Impact:** I moved in **6 weeks earlier**—saved 2 months of apartment rent ($1,800) and lived in my new home sooner.

### Reason #3: Simpler Draw Process

**Standard 203(k) draws:** 4-6 draws, each requiring HUD consultant inspection (7-10 days per draw)

**Limited 203(k) draws:** 2 draws, regular FHA inspector (5-7 days per draw)

**Impact:** Contractor finished faster (42 days vs. typical 75-90 days for Standard 203(k)).

### Reason #4: Less Stressful

**Standard 203(k) stress points:**
- Finding HUD consultant
- Detailed work write-up creation
- Multiple draw inspections
- Potential draw rejections (if work doesn't match spec)

**Limited 203(k) stress points:**
- Finding contractor (easier—fewer refuse Limited 203(k))
- Submitting feasibility study (simple 2-page form)
- 2 draw inspections (straightforward)

**Impact:** I had a **much smoother experience** than friends who used Standard 203(k) for similar-sized projects.

## When Limited FHA 203(k) Is Perfect (And When It's Not)

### Perfect For:

✅ **Cosmetic-only updates** (kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, paint)  
✅ **Renovations under $35,000**  
✅ **First-time buyers** who want a simpler process  
✅ **Buyers with 620-639 credit** (Limited allows 3.5% down at 620+, Standard requires 640+)  
✅ **Buyers who want to close fast** (30-45 days vs. 60-90)

### NOT Suitable For:

❌ **Structural repairs** (foundation, framing, roof replacement)  
❌ **Major system replacements** (HVAC, electrical panel, plumbing systems)  
❌ **Renovations over $35,000**  
❌ **Properties in severe distress** (condemned, uninhabitable)

**If your renovation needs structural work or exceeds $35,000, you'll need Standard FHA 203(k).**

## How to Decide: Limited vs. Standard FHA 203(k)

### Ask Yourself:

**1. Are all repairs cosmetic (no structural work)?**
- Yes → Limited might work
- No → Standard required

**2. Is the total renovation cost under $35,000?**
- Yes → Limited might work
- No → Standard required

**3. Is your credit score 620-639?**
- Yes → Limited is your only 3.5% down option
- No (640+) → Both options available

**4. Do you need to close quickly?**
- Yes (within 30-45 days) → Limited is faster
- No (60-90 days OK) → Either works

**5. Do you want the simplest process?**
- Yes → Limited is simpler
- No (OK with complexity) → Either works

**If you answered "yes" to most of these, Limited FHA 203(k) is likely your best choice.**

## The Bottom Line

- ✅ Under $35,000 cap
- ✅ Cosmetic only (kitchen, bathroom, flooring, paint)

**What I saved:**
