I bought a 1980s ranch for $192,000 that needed work.

**My repair list:**
- Kitchen cabinets and countertops: $12,500
- Bathroom vanity and fixtures: $6,800
- Flooring throughout: $8,200
- Interior paint: $3,100
- Appliances: $1,900

**Total repairs: $32,500**

My loan officer said, "You need an FHA 203(k) loan," and put me into a **Standard 203(k)** program.

**What I didn't know:** There are **two types** of FHA 203(k) loans—and I chose the wrong one.

**The cost of my mistake:**
- **$1,100 HUD consultant fee** (unnecessary for Limited 203k)
- **6 extra weeks** of closing delays
- **Added stress** from HUD consultant reviews and paperwork

Here's what I learned about **Standard vs. Limited FHA 203(k)**—and how to choose the right program for your fixer-upper.

## The Two Types of FHA 203(k) Loans

### Standard FHA 203(k)

**Repair limits:** Unlimited (no cap on renovation costs)

**Allowed work:**
- Structural repairs (foundation, framing)
- Additions (rooms, second stories, garages)
- Major systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical panels)
- Cosmetic updates (kitchens, bathrooms, flooring)

**Requirements:**
- HUD consultant required ($800-$1,500 fee)
- Detailed renovation plans and contractor bids
- Draw schedule with inspections at each stage
- 60-90 day closing timeline

**Credit:** 640+ for 3.5% down (580-639 requires 10% down)

**Best for:** Major structural work, large renovations over $35,000, homes needing foundation/roof/major systems

### Limited FHA 203(k)

**Repair limits:** Up to $35,000 in total renovation costs

**Allowed work:**
- Cosmetic updates only (no structural work)
- Kitchen/bathroom remodels
- Flooring, painting, appliances
- Roof repair (not full replacement)
- HVAC repair (not full replacement)

**Requirements:**
- No HUD consultant required
- Simplified bid process
- Payment in 1-2 draws (not 5+ like Standard)
- 30-45 day closing timeline

**Credit:** 620+ for 3.5% down (580-619 requires 10% down)

**Best for:** Cosmetic updates under $35,000, no structural work, faster closing needed

## My Project: $32,500 in Cosmetic Repairs

### What I Needed

**Kitchen:** New cabinets and quartz countertops ($12,500)  
**Bathroom:** New vanity, toilet, fixtures, and tile ($6,800)  
**Flooring:** Luxury vinyl plank throughout ($8,200)  
**Paint:** Entire interior repaint ($3,100)  
**Appliances:** Refrigerator, range, dishwasher ($1,900)

**Total: $32,500** (under the $35,000 Limited 203k cap)

**No structural work. No foundation. No major systems.**

**I qualified for Limited FHA 203(k)—but my loan officer put me into Standard 203(k) instead.**

## Why My Loan Officer Chose Standard (And Why It Was Wrong)

### Their Reasoning

**Loan officer's explanation:** "Your total is close to $35,000, and if you discover any surprises during renovation, you might go over the limit. Standard 203(k) is safer."

**Sounds logical, right?**

**The problem:** Limited 203(k) has a built-in contingency reserve (10-20% of renovation budget) to cover surprises.

**My contingency reserve:** $3,250-$6,500 (which would've covered surprises up to $38,500-$41,500 total)

**Reality:** I never needed to exceed $35,000. My final costs were $33,800 (under budget by $1,700).

**Their real reason:** Many loan officers **don't fully understand Limited 203(k)** or rarely close them—so they default to Standard 203(k) for everything.

## What Standard FHA 203(k) Cost Me (That Limited Would've Avoided)

### Extra Cost #1: HUD Consultant Fee ($1,100)

**Standard 203(k) requirement:** HUD consultant must review bids, create work plans, inspect draws

**My HUD consultant fee:** $1,100

**Limited 203(k) requirement:** No HUD consultant needed

**Money wasted:** $1,100

### Extra Cost #2: Extended Timeline (6 Weeks)

**Standard 203(k) closing timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Find HUD consultant, schedule property inspection
- Week 3-4: Contractor bids reviewed by consultant, work plan created
- Week 5-8: Lender underwrites with consultant reports
- Week 9-10: Final approval and closing

**Total: 75 days from offer to close**

**Limited 203(k) closing timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Contractor bids submitted directly to lender
- Week 3-4: Lender underwrites (no consultant review needed)
- Week 5: Final approval and closing

**Total: 35 days from offer to close**

**Difference: 40 days (nearly 6 weeks)**

**My situation:** I had to extend my apartment lease by 2 months (month-to-month premium rate) because closing took so long.

**Extra rent cost:** $1,800 (2 months at $900/month premium vs. signing new 12-month lease)

### Extra Cost #3: More Complicated Draw Process

**Standard 203(k) draws:** 5 separate draw requests, each requiring HUD consultant inspection before payment

**Limited 203(k) draws:** 1-2 draws (often just a 50% midpoint draw and final payment)

**Impact:**
- My contractor had to wait **7-10 days after each inspection** to get paid
- This slowed down the project timeline by **2-3 weeks total**
- Contractor charged me **$800 extra** to cover their carrying costs for delayed payments

**Total cost of choosing Standard instead of Limited:**
- HUD consultant fee: $1,100
- Extra rent (lease extension): $1,800
- Contractor delay fees: $800
- **Total: $3,700 wasted**

## When Should You Choose Standard FHA 203(k)?

### You NEED Standard If:

✅ **Repairs exceed $35,000** (even with contingency reserve)  
✅ **Structural work required** (foundation, framing, load-bearing walls)  
✅ **Major system replacements** (full HVAC, electrical panel, plumbing systems)  
✅ **Roof replacement** (full tear-off and replacement)  
✅ **Additions** (adding rooms, second stories, garages)  
✅ **You're buying a property in severe distress** (uninhabitable, condemned, major code violations)

### Examples Where Standard Is Necessary:

**Property #1:** $180,000 purchase + $65,000 renovation (exceeds $35K limit) = **Standard required**

**Property #2:** Foundation cracks need $8,000 repair + $22,000 cosmetic updates = **Standard required** (structural work)

**Property #3:** Roof replacement $14,000 + HVAC replacement $8,500 + kitchen remodel $18,000 = **Standard required** (major systems + over $35K)

## When Should You Choose Limited FHA 203(k)?

### You CAN Use Limited If:

✅ **Repairs under $35,000 total** (including contingency)  
✅ **Cosmetic work only** (kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, paint)  
✅ **Minor repairs** (appliances, fixtures, windows, doors)  
✅ **Roof repair** (not full replacement)  
✅ **HVAC repair** (not full replacement)  
✅ **You want faster closing** (30-45 days vs. 60-90)

### Examples Where Limited Works:

**Property #1:** $210,000 purchase + $28,000 in kitchen/bathroom/flooring = **Limited works**

**Property #2:** $195,000 purchase + $33,000 cosmetic updates = **Limited works**

**Property #3:** $188,000 purchase + $32,500 (my project) = **Limited works** (but I chose Standard anyway—mistake!)

## How to Know Which Program You Need

### Step 1: Get Contractor Estimates

**Before applying for the loan**, get 2-3 contractor estimates for your renovation scope.

**Questions to ask contractors:**
- Is any structural work required? (If yes → Standard)
- Are major systems being replaced? (If yes → Standard)
- What's the total estimated cost? (If over $35K → Standard)

### Step 2: Check Your Credit Score

**Limited 203(k):** 620+ credit for 3.5% down  
**Standard 203(k):** 640+ credit for 3.5% down

If your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> is 620-639, **Limited 203(k) is your only option** with 3.5% down (unless you put 10% down for Standard).

### Step 3: Consider Timeline

**Need to close in 30-45 days?** Choose **Limited** if your project qualifies (under $35K, cosmetic only).

**Can wait 60-90 days?** Either program works—choose based on repair scope.

### Step 4: Talk to an FHA 203(k) Specialist

**Critical:** Not all loan officers understand the differences between Standard and Limited programs.

**Find a loan officer through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> who:**
- Closes both Standard and Limited 203(k) loans regularly (not just one or the other)
- Can clearly explain which program fits your specific project
- Won't default to Standard for every situation

## What I Should've Done Differently

### My Mistake

**What I did:** Trusted my loan officer's recommendation without researching Standard vs. Limited differences.

**What I should've done:**
1. Researched FHA 203(k) programs BEFORE finding a lender
2. Asked my loan officer: "Why Standard instead of Limited?"
3. Got a second opinion from another FHA 203(k) lender
4. Compared closing timelines and fees for both programs

### If I Could Go Back

**I would've:**
- Used **Limited FHA 203(k)** for my $32,500 cosmetic project
- Saved **$1,100** on HUD consultant fees
- Closed **6 weeks faster**
- Avoided **$1,800** in extra rent
- Reduced contractor fees by **$800**

**Total savings: $3,700** + 6 weeks of time

## The Bottom Line: Choose Wisely

**Standard FHA 203(k) is powerful**—unlimited repairs, structural work, major renovations.

**But if you don't need it, you're paying for features you'll never use:**
- HUD consultant fees ($800-$1,500)
- Longer closing (60-90 days vs. 30-45)
- More complex draw schedules
- More paperwork and inspections

**Limited FHA 203(k) is perfect** for cosmetic updates under $35,000:
- No HUD consultant needed
- Faster closing (30-45 days)
- Simpler process
- Lower overall costs

**My advice:**

✅ **If your repairs are under $35K and cosmetic-only → Use Limited 203(k)**  
✅ **If your repairs exceed $35K or include structural work → Use Standard 203(k)**  
✅ **If you're unsure → Get contractor estimates first, then decide**
