I thought the hardest part of my FHA 203(k) renovation would be **finding a contractor** or **managing the budget**.

**I was wrong.**

**The hardest part:** Passing HUD consultant draw inspections.

**My renovation:** $52,000 (kitchen, two bathrooms, HVAC replacement, flooring)  
**Draw schedule:** 5 draws over 90 days  
**Inspections passed on first try:** 3 out of 5  
**Inspections failed:** 2 (Draw #3 and Draw #4)

**Why they failed:**
- **Draw #3 fail:** Kitchen cabinets were 36 inches tall instead of 42 inches (didn't match work write-up)
- **Draw #4 fail:** Electrical rough-in had missing junction box cover and wrong-gauge wire for range circuit

**Cost of failures:**
- **Time:** 12 days of project delays (waiting for corrections and re-inspections)
- **Money:** $500 in re-inspection fees (2 failures × $250 each)
- **Stress:** Contractor was frustrated, I was anxious, timeline was blown

**What I learned:** HUD consultant inspections are **thorough**—they check every detail against the approved work write-up, and they **will not pass** work that doesn't match the spec (even if it's "good enough").

Here's what FHA inspectors actually check during each draw inspection, why contractors fail, and how to pass on the first try.

## How FHA 203(k) Draw Inspections Work

### The Draw Schedule

**FHA 203(k) loans release funds in stages** (called "draws") as work is completed.

**Typical draw schedule for a $52,000 renovation:**

| Draw # | Work Completed | Amount |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation/structural, HVAC rough-in | $12,400 |
| 2 | HVAC complete, kitchen demo and framing | $9,800 |
| 3 | Kitchen cabinets, countertops, electrical rough-in | $14,200 |
| 4 | Bathroom tile, fixtures, final electrical | $10,600 |
| 5 | Flooring, paint, final walkthrough | $5,000 |

**Total:** $52,000

### The Inspection Process

**Step 1:** Contractor completes work for a draw milestone

**Step 2:** Contractor submits draw request to lender (with photos and invoices)

**Step 3:** Lender notifies HUD consultant to schedule inspection

**Step 4:** HUD consultant inspects property (usually within 3-5 business days)

**Step 5:** HUD consultant submits inspection report to lender
- **Pass:** Lender releases funds to contractor (within 5-7 business days)
- **Fail:** Contractor must correct deficiencies and request re-inspection ($200-$300 fee)

**Step 6:** If failed, repeat Steps 4-5 until work passes

### What Inspectors Check

**Every draw inspection checks:**
- ✅ **Work matches the approved work write-up** (materials, dimensions, methods)
- ✅ **Work is completed per the draw milestone** (not 80% done—100% done)
- ✅ **Work meets local building codes** (electrical, plumbing, structural)
- ✅ **Work quality is acceptable** (no visible defects, proper installation)
- ✅ **Safety standards are met** (no exposed wiring, trip hazards, code violations)

**If any of these fail, the draw is rejected.**

## My Draw #1 Inspection (Passed): Foundation + HVAC Rough-In

### What Was Supposed to Be Done

**Foundation work:**
- Repair cracked foundation wall (epoxy injection method)
- Install drainage system around perimeter (French drain)

**HVAC rough-in:**
- Remove old furnace and AC unit
- Install new ductwork (revised layout per HVAC contractor's plan)
- Run electrical for new HVAC unit (240V circuit to outdoor condenser)

### What the HUD Consultant Inspected

**Foundation inspection (15 minutes):**
- Checked crack repair method (verified epoxy injection was used, not surface patching)
- Measured drainage system depth (required 18 inches below grade—passed at 20 inches)
- Took photos of completed foundation work (before backfilling)

**HVAC rough-in inspection (20 minutes):**
- Verified old furnace and AC were removed (checked for proper refrigerant disposal—required by EPA)
- Measured new ductwork (checked sizes matched HVAC load calculation—8-inch trunk, 6-inch branches)
- Checked electrical rough-in (240V circuit with proper gauge wire—10/2 for 30-amp circuit)
- Verified ductwork was sealed (checked for mastic or foil tape—no duct tape allowed)

**Consultant's notes:** "Foundation repair per spec. HVAC rough-in complete and code-compliant. Approved for Draw #1."

**Funds released:** $12,400 within 6 business days

**Why this passed:** Contractor followed the work write-up exactly, used proper materials, and completed 100% of the milestone work.

## My Draw #2 Inspection (Passed): HVAC Complete + Kitchen Demo

### What Was Supposed to Be Done

**HVAC completion:**
- Install new furnace (95% AFUE, specified brand and model)
- Install new AC condenser (16 SEER, specified brand and model)
- Connect ductwork to new furnace
- Install thermostat (programmable, specified model)
- Test system (heating and cooling functional)

**Kitchen demo:**
- Remove old cabinets, countertops, and appliances
- Demo tile backsplash and flooring
- Frame new opening for peninsula (removing part of wall, adding header beam)
- Rough-in electrical for new outlets and lighting (per electrical plan)
- Rough-in plumbing for new sink and dishwasher (relocating 3 feet from original location)

### What the HUD Consultant Inspected

**HVAC inspection (25 minutes):**
- Checked furnace model number (matched work write-up—Carrier 59MN7)
- Checked AC condenser model number (matched work write-up—Carrier 24ACC6)
- Measured supply and return air temps (verified 15-20°F temperature split—proper operation)
- Checked thermostat installation (wired correctly, programmable model installed)
- Verified manufacturer labels on units (serial numbers recorded)

**Kitchen demo inspection (30 minutes):**
- Verified all old cabinets, countertops removed (checked for damage-free removal—walls intact)
- Checked framing for peninsula opening (verified header beam size—double 2×8 LVL beam required for 6-foot span)
- Inspected electrical rough-in (counted outlets—8 required per plan, 8 installed)
- Checked plumbing rough-in (verified sink drain and water supply in new location)
- Took photos of exposed framing and rough-ins (for record before closing walls)

**Consultant's notes:** "HVAC complete and operational. Kitchen demo and rough-ins per spec. Approved for Draw #2."

**Funds released:** $9,800 within 5 business days

**Why this passed:** Contractor installed exact models specified in work write-up, completed all demo work, and properly framed new opening with correct header beam size.

## My Draw #3 Inspection (FAILED): Kitchen Cabinets + Countertops

### What Was Supposed to Be Done

**Kitchen cabinets:**
- Install upper cabinets (42 inches tall, soft-close hinges, Shaker-style white)
- Install base cabinets (matching style)
- Install crown molding on upper cabinets
- Install hardware (brushed nickel pulls and knobs)

**Countertops:**
- Install quartz countertops (specified color and thickness—Caesarstone "London Grey" 3cm)
- Install undermount sink
- Install faucet (specified model—Moen Arbor)

**Backsplash:**
- Install tile backsplash (white subway tile 3×6, specified pattern)

**Electrical rough-in:**
- Install outlets for appliances (range, dishwasher, microwave, disposal)
- Install under-cabinet lighting (LED strips)

### What the HUD Consultant Found

**Cabinet inspection (20 minutes):**
- ❌ **FAIL:** Upper cabinets were 36 inches tall (not 42 inches per work write-up)
- ✅ Soft-close hinges installed correctly
- ✅ Crown molding installed
- ✅ Hardware installed (brushed nickel as specified)

**Countertop inspection (15 minutes):**
- ✅ Quartz countertops installed (verified Caesarstone label—correct color)
- ✅ Undermount sink installed properly (no leaks, sealed correctly)
- ✅ Faucet installed (Moen Arbor model verified)

**Backsplash inspection (10 minutes):**
- ✅ White subway tile installed correctly (pattern matched work write-up)

**Electrical rough-in inspection (10 minutes):**
- ✅ Outlets installed for appliances
- ✅ Under-cabinet lighting installed

**Consultant's report:** "Upper cabinets do not match work write-up specification (36-inch height vs. required 42-inch). Draw REJECTED. Contractor must install correct cabinets and request re-inspection."

### Why This Failed

**The work write-up specified:** "Upper cabinets: 42 inches tall (to maximize storage and reach 8-foot ceiling with crown molding)"

**What the contractor installed:** 36-inch upper cabinets (standard height—6 inches shorter)

**Contractor's explanation:** "36-inch uppers are standard. 42-inch uppers are more expensive, and I didn't think it mattered."

**My response:** "The work write-up is legally binding—you have to install what's specified. This is what the lender approved."

**HUD consultant's position:** "I can't approve cabinets that don't match the spec. If you want to change to 36-inch cabinets, you need a formal change order approved by the lender."

**Options:**
1. Contractor removes 36-inch cabinets and installs correct 42-inch cabinets (contractor eats the cost—$1,800)
2. Borrower and contractor submit change order to lender to approve 36-inch cabinets (adds 7-10 days for approval)

**We chose Option #1** (contractor's mistake, contractor's cost) because I wanted the 42-inch cabinets as originally planned.

**Re-inspection timeline:**
- Contractor ordered 42-inch cabinets: 5 days
- Contractor removed 36-inch cabinets and installed 42-inch cabinets: 3 days
- Re-inspection scheduled: 2 days
- Re-inspection passed: Day 10

**Total delay:** 10 days

**Re-inspection fee:** $250 (paid by contractor, but I had to negotiate this—contractor initially wanted me to pay)

## My Draw #4 Inspection (FAILED): Bathrooms + Final Electrical

### What Was Supposed to Be Done

**Master bathroom:**
- Install tile (floor and shower walls)
- Install shower pan and fixtures (rain showerhead, handheld wand)
- Install vanity (60-inch double sink)
- Install toilet
- Install mirror and lighting

**Guest bathroom:**
- Install tile (floor only)
- Install vanity (36-inch single sink)
- Install toilet
- Install mirror and lighting

**Final electrical:**
- Install all light fixtures (recessed lights, pendant over peninsula, bathroom vanity lights)
- Install outlets and switches
- Install range (240V circuit)
- Connect all electrical per final electrical plan

### What the HUD Consultant Found

**Master bathroom inspection (20 minutes):**
- ✅ Tile installed correctly (proper spacing, grout lines, waterproofing behind shower tile)
- ✅ Shower pan and fixtures installed (tested—no leaks)
- ✅ Vanity installed correctly
- ✅ Toilet installed (tested—no leaks)
- ✅ Mirror and lighting installed

**Guest bathroom inspection (10 minutes):**
- ✅ Tile installed correctly
- ✅ Vanity and toilet installed
- ✅ Mirror and lighting installed

**Electrical inspection (25 minutes):**
- ✅ Light fixtures installed correctly (recessed lights, pendants, vanity lights)
- ✅ Outlets and switches installed
- ❌ **FAIL:** Range circuit (240V) was wired with 12-gauge wire (should be 10-gauge for 40-amp circuit)
- ❌ **FAIL:** Junction box in kitchen ceiling missing cover plate (exposed wiring—code violation)

**Consultant's report:** "Bathrooms complete and acceptable. Electrical FAIL: Range circuit undersized (fire hazard). Junction box missing cover (code violation). Draw REJECTED."

### Why This Failed

**Issue #1: Range circuit undersized**

**Range specifications (from appliance manual):** Requires 40-amp dedicated circuit with 10-gauge wire minimum

**What the electrician installed:** 12-gauge wire (rated for 20-amp circuit—not sufficient for 40-amp range)

**Why this matters:** Undersized wire can overheat and cause a fire when the range is operated at full capacity (all burners + oven).

**Electrician's explanation:** "I misread the range specs—I thought it was a 30-amp range. My mistake."

**Correction:** Electrician had to pull new 10-gauge wire from breaker panel to range outlet (took 4 hours)

**Issue #2: Missing junction box cover**

**Code requirement:** All junction boxes must have covers (no exposed wiring)

**What the electrician missed:** One junction box in the kitchen ceiling (where old light fixture was removed) had no cover plate.

**Why this matters:** Exposed wiring is a code violation and a safety hazard (risk of shock or fire if insulation contacts wiring).

**Correction:** Electrician installed blank cover plate (took 10 minutes—simple fix, but still failed the inspection)

### Re-Inspection Timeline

**Day 1:** Electrician pulled new 10-gauge wire to range outlet  
**Day 2:** Electrician installed junction box cover  
**Day 3:** Re-inspection scheduled  
**Day 4:** Re-inspection passed

**Total delay:** 4 days (faster than Draw #3 failure because corrections were simpler)

**Re-inspection fee:** $250 (electrician paid this—his mistake)

## My Draw #5 Inspection (Passed): Final Completion

### What Was Supposed to Be Done

**Flooring:**
- Install luxury vinyl plank throughout (living room, hallway, bedrooms—1,100 sq ft)

**Paint:**
- Prime and paint all walls (2 coats)
- Paint trim and baseboards
- Touch-up any damaged areas from construction

**Final details:**
- Install all door hardware (handles, locks)
- Install closet shelving (wire shelving systems)
- Final cleaning (remove construction debris, vacuum, wipe surfaces)

### What the HUD Consultant Inspected

**Flooring inspection (20 minutes):**
- Checked installation quality (no gaps, proper expansion space at walls, seams aligned)
- Verified material matched work write-up (checked product label—correct brand and style)

**Paint inspection (15 minutes):**
- Checked coverage (no visible primer showing through, even color)
- Checked trim and baseboards (clean lines, no drips)
- Checked for damage from construction (patched and painted correctly)

**Final details inspection (10 minutes):**
- Checked door hardware installation (all doors open/close smoothly, locks functional)
- Checked closet shelving (properly anchored to walls, level)

**Final walkthrough (30 minutes):**
- Walked through entire property with me and contractor
- Checked all prior draw work (spot-checking to ensure nothing was damaged or altered)
- Verified all work from work write-up was complete
- Created punch list (minor touch-ups—3 small paint touch-ups, 1 cabinet door adjustment)

**Consultant's notes:** "All work complete per approved scope. Minor punch-list items noted (can be completed before final FHA inspection). Approved for Draw #5."

**Funds released:** $5,000 within 5 business days

**Punch-list items:** Contractor completed in 1 day (no re-inspection needed for minor items)

**Why this passed:** All work was complete, materials matched work write-up, and quality was acceptable. Minor punch-list items are normal and don't fail the draw.

## What HUD Consultants Check at Each Draw (Summary)

### Structural/Foundation Draws

✅ **Materials match work write-up** (epoxy injection vs. surface patching, beam sizes, etc.)  
✅ **Work is code-compliant** (proper depths, drainage, reinforcement)  
✅ **Work is complete** (not 90% done—100% done)

### Rough-In Draws (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical)

✅ **Proper wire gauge** (electrical circuits sized for loads)  
✅ **Proper pipe sizes** (plumbing supply and drain lines)  
✅ **Code-compliant installations** (junction boxes covered, GFCI outlets in wet areas)  
✅ **Systems functional** (HVAC heats/cools, plumbing doesn't leak)

### Finish Draws (Cabinets, Tile, Flooring)

✅ **Materials match work write-up** (cabinet heights, tile sizes, flooring brands)  
✅ **Quality installation** (level cabinets, straight grout lines, no gaps in flooring)  
✅ **Work is complete** (all hardware installed, trim installed, no missing pieces)

### Final Draws

✅ **All work from work write-up is complete**  
✅ **Punch-list items are minor** (small touch-ups, adjustments)  
✅ **Property is clean and ready for occupancy**

## Why Contractors Fail Inspections (Top 5 Reasons)

### Reason #1: Didn't Read the Work Write-Up

**My contractor's cabinet mistake:** Installed 36-inch uppers instead of 42-inch (didn't read the spec)

**Prevention:** Contractors should review the work write-up **before ordering materials** and confirm all specs with the borrower.

### Reason #2: Cut Corners to Save Money

**Common corner-cutting:**
- Using cheaper materials than specified (e.g., laminate countertops instead of quartz)
- Skipping steps (e.g., no underlayment under flooring)
- Using wrong sizes (e.g., 12-gauge wire instead of 10-gauge to save $40)

**Prevention:** HUD consultants check material labels and verify installations match specs—corner-cutting gets caught.

### Reason #3: Didn't Understand Code Requirements

**My electrician's mistake:** Missing junction box cover (simple code violation, but failed the draw)

**Prevention:** Contractors should have electricians and plumbers who are **code-certified** and familiar with local building codes.

### Reason #4: Rushed the Work

**Common rush mistakes:**
- Incomplete work (e.g., 90% of tile installed, missing grout in corners)
- Sloppy installations (e.g., uneven cabinet alignment, crooked flooring seams)

**Prevention:** Contractors should **not request a draw until work is 100% complete**—HUD consultants will reject incomplete work.

### Reason #5: Poor Communication with HUD Consultant

**Example:** Contractor made a field change (moved an outlet 6 inches from original location) without telling anyone—HUD consultant rejected it because it didn't match the plan.

**Prevention:** Any deviations from the work write-up require **written change orders approved by the lender and borrower** before the work is done.

## How to Pass Inspections on the First Try

### For Borrowers

✅ **Hire experienced FHA 203(k) contractors** (10+ projects minimum)  
✅ **Review the work write-up with your contractor** before work starts  
✅ **Walk the job site weekly** to verify work matches the plan  
✅ **Communicate changes immediately** (don't wait until inspection day to discover issues)

### For Contractors

✅ **Read the work write-up before ordering materials** (verify every spec—dimensions, brands, colors)  
✅ **Follow the work write-up exactly** (don't substitute materials or change dimensions without a change order)  
✅ **Complete 100% of the draw milestone** before requesting inspection (not 95%—100%)  
✅ **Self-inspect before calling for HUD consultant** (walk through with the work write-up and check every item)  
✅ **Communicate with the HUD consultant** (if you're unsure about a spec, call them before installing)

## The Bottom Line

**HUD consultant draw inspections are thorough**—they check every detail against the approved work write-up.

**My experience:**
- **5 draws** over 90 days
- **2 failed inspections** (cabinets wrong height, electrical undersized and missing cover)
- **$500 in re-inspection fees**
- **14 days of delays**

**What I learned:**
- HUD consultants will **not pass** work that doesn't match the work write-up (even if it's "good enough")
- Contractors must follow specs **exactly**—no substitutions without change orders
- **Hiring experienced FHA 203(k) contractors** avoids most inspection failures

**If you're starting an FHA 203(k) renovation:**

✅ Hire contractors with **10+ FHA 203(k) projects** (they know the inspection process)  
✅ Review the work write-up with your contractor **before work starts**  
✅ Budget for **1-2 re-inspections** ($250-$500)—even experienced contractors occasionally fail  
✅ Add **5-10 days** to your timeline for potential re-inspections
