## Rate Lock Timing Strategy: When to Lock, When to Float, and Market Signals

One of the biggest decisions in a mortgage closing is **when to lock your rate**. Lock too early and you might miss a 0.25% drop; float too long and rates spike 0.50% overnight. Brokers who master rate-lock timing save their clients thousands—and speed up closings.

Understanding lock vs. float is the power key to controlling your closing cost and stress.

### What "Lock" and "Float" Mean

**Lock:** You agree to a specific rate (e.g., 6.00%) for a set lock period (typically 30, 45, or 60 days). If rates fall, you keep your 6.00%. If rates rise, you still get 6.00%—but the lender profits because they're short. Lenders charge for the security of a lock.

**Float:** Your rate is "floating" until you lock it. If rates fall, your rate falls with them (bonus). If rates rise, your rate rises too (pain). You're betting on favorable market movement.

### The Economics of Locking

When you lock, the **lender hedges** (sells 10-year Treasury futures) to protect themselves from rate declines. This hedge costs money—usually 0.125% to 0.50% in rate (depending on market conditions and how many days you're locking).

**Example:**
- **Float** for 7 days (no lock): Quoted 5.875%
- **Lock for 30 days**: Quoted 6.00% (lock cost: +0.125%)
- **Lock for 45 days**: Quoted 6.125% (longer lock = higher cost)
- **Lock for 60 days**: Quoted 6.25% (even longer = even higher cost)

If you lock 45 days but only need 30, you're paying for 15 extra days of protection you don't use. Brokers optimize lock length to match your actual timeline.

### Market Signals: Reading the Tea Leaves

Brokers who win on lock timing watch **three key indicators**:

#### 1. The 10-Year Treasury Yield

Mortgage rates track the 10-year Treasury yield almost perfectly (with a 0.50%–0.75% spread called the "primary mortgage market survey spread").

**What to watch:**
- **10Y below 4.00%**: Historically low; expect mortgage rates below 6.00% and downward pressure.
- **10Y at 4.00%–4.50%**: Neutral zone; rates could go either way.
- **10Y above 4.50%**: Rising pressure; rates likely climbing.

Brokers check the 10Y yield daily and know if there's upward or downward momentum.

#### 2. Federal Reserve Signals

The Fed sets the federal funds rate, which influences longer-term rates. Key events:

- **FOMC meeting dates**: Scheduled rate-decision days (every 6 weeks). Expect volatility.
- **Fed commentary**: If the Fed signals rate cuts, 10Y yields fall, and mortgage rates drop.
- **Inflation data**: Higher inflation = Fed stays higher for longer = rates stay elevated.
- **Employment data**: Jobs reports signal economic strength and influence Fed thinking.

**Broker insight:** If the Fed is signaling rate cuts (like in November 2024), floating for a few weeks might be smart. If the Fed is hawkish (holding rates high), locking early is safer.

#### 3. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) Hedging Activity

Lenders hedge their pipeline using MSR futures and swaptions. When lenders see rising rate risk, they often lower rates to lock loans (locking the hedge in place). Brokers with trader relationships know when lenders are aggressive on pricing.

**Broker signal:** "Lenders are aggressively priced today; I'd lock if you can."

### The Lock Timing Playbook

#### Scenario 1: Rates Are Rising (Bearish)

**Market signals:** 10Y yields climbing, Fed forecasting higher rates, inflation cooling slower than expected.

**Broker recommendation:** Lock early (within 7–14 days of underwriting submission).

**Why:** Rates will likely continue rising. Locking early captures today's (relatively better) rate and avoids regret if rates spike 0.50%+ before closing.

**Timeframe:** 45–60 day locks to give underwriting, appraisal, and title time to complete.

**Example:** It's November 2024, 10Y is at 4.50% and climbing. Broker recommends locking at 6.25% because Fed expects to hold rates steady and growth is strong. You lock for 45 days. Rate climbs to 6.75% by early January—you're protected and save $175/month.

#### Scenario 2: Rates Are Falling (Bullish)

**Market signals:** 10Y yields declining, Fed signaling rate cuts, economic slowdown, low inflation.

**Broker recommendation:** Float and monitor.

**Why:** Rates will likely continue falling. Floating lets you capture the decline without paying lock costs.

**Timeframe:** 7–14 day float with a plan to lock if/when rate target is hit.

**Example:** It's August 2024, Fed just cut rates 0.25%, 10Y is at 3.80% and falling. Broker says "Float for now; if we see 5.50%, lock." Rates drift to 5.40% by week 2—you lock and save $50/month compared to locking today at 5.75%.

#### Scenario 3: Rates Are Neutral (Sideways)

**Market signals:** 10Y yields flat, Fed data mixed, economic data inconsistent.

**Broker recommendation:** Lock if your timeline is tight; float if you have flexibility.

**Why:** No clear directional signal. Locking locks in today's rate (safe for timeline). Floating bets that you're right about direction (risky).

**Timeframe:** If locking, use a 30–45 day lock to match typical closing timelines.

**Example:** It's November 2024, 10Y is at 4.30% and bouncing around. Broker says "Rates could go either way. If you close in 30 days, lock now. If you have 45+ days, you can float a week and reassess."

### The Float-Down Option

One compromise: **ask for a float-down option** (also called a "rate cap and relock" or "float-down renegotiation").

**How it works:** You lock a rate (e.g., 6.00% for 45 days), but negotiate an option to re-lock lower if rates drop. Common terms:
- Lock at 6.00%, option to re-lock once to 5.75% or lower (if rates fall)
- Lock cost: +0.125%, float-down option cost: +0.25% (so total +0.375%)

**Best for:** Neutral or bullish markets where you want protection upside but might capture downside.

**Example:** You lock at 6.00% with a float-down to 5.75% for +0.375% total. Rates fall to 5.60%—you re-lock at 5.75% and save money vs. floating. Rates rise to 6.50%—you keep your 6.00% lock.

### Lender Lock Behavior: Reading the Market

Top brokers know that **lender pricing moves** based on their hedging appetite. When lenders are aggressive:

- **They lower rates** to lock more loans (they've already hedged the interest rate risk via futures)
- **They extend lock periods** without charge (30→45 days free)
- **They offer lender credits** or rebates

Brokers capitalize on these windows:

**Example conversation:** Broker calls lender trader: "I have a strong file. What's your best pricing on a 45-day lock?" Trader responds: "We're aggressively priced today—6.00% on your profile, 45 days, no lock cost vs. 30-day pricing." Broker locks you that day.

### Documentation Timing Matters

Locking timing also connects to **documentation readiness**:

- **Lock early** (days 3–7): Gives underwriting 35–40 days to work without time pressure
- **Lock mid** (days 14–21): Gives underwriting 25–35 days; faster but riskier if conditions pile up
- **Lock late** (days 28+): Risky; underwriting has <17 days to clear conditions and close

Brokers typically recommend: **Lock when your file is submitted to underwriting**, not when you sign the application. This way, underwriting has the full lock period to work.

### Personal Factors: Non-Market Considerations

Even if rates are falling, sometimes you should lock early:

1. **Job change risk**: If you might change jobs or lose income, lock early to secure your rate before the income change surfaces.
2. **Credit inquiry risk**: If you have recent hard inquiries or credit events, lock early before underwriting reviews credit in detail.
3. **Appraisal risk**: If the property is in a hot market or unique (worth concern), lock early to secure rate before appraisal surprises.
4. **Emotional certainty**: If floating will stress you out, lock and sleep at night. Peace of mind is worth 0.125% sometimes.

### Red Flags: When Brokers Advise Against Floating

1. **Rates already at multi-year highs.** If 10Y is above 4.50% and has climbed steadily, more upside risk than downside.
2. **Major Fed or economic events upcoming** (FOMC, jobs report). Volatility risk is real; locking before uncertainty is smart.
3. **Your timeline is tight** (closing in 21–30 days). Lock costs more than floating, but time risk (closing delayed) is worse.
4. **Jumbo or non-QM loan.** These markets are less liquid and more volatile; lock sooner to ensure lender availability.

### Questions to Ask Your Broker About Locking

1. **"What's your recommendation—lock or float? Why?"** (Get their reasoning)
2. **"What's the lock cost for 30 vs. 45 vs. 60 days?"** (Quantify the trade-off)
3. **"Can we get a float-down option? What's the cost?"** (Explore hybrids)
4. **"When should we lock relative to underwriting submission?"** (Timeline alignment)
5. **"What market signals are you watching?"** (Understand their method)
6. **"If rates drop 0.25%, is there a renegotiation or extension option?"** (Understand downside options)

### The Bottom Line

Rate lock timing blends market analysis, personal timeline, and lender behavior:

- **Lock early** if rates are rising, your timeline is tight, or you want certainty.
- **Float** if rates are falling and your timeline is flexible.
- **Lock with float-down** if you want protection with upside potential.
- **Ask your broker** for market opinion and lock recommendations based on data, not hope.

Saving 0.25%–0.50% on your rate lock is worth $75–150/month. That's real money—and brokers earn it by timing locks well.

**Next step:** Ask your Texas broker: "What's your outlook on rates? Should I lock or float?" Use their market view to make your decision.
