## Documentation Playbook: How Brokers Clear Conditions Fast

One of the biggest delays in mortgage closings isn't rate locking or appraisals—it's **conditions**. Lenders issue conditions when they need more documentation to verify income, assets, employment, or credit. Every condition extends closing by 3–7 days.

Smart brokers **front-load documentation** to minimize conditions. Here's how they do it—and how you can help speed your closing.

### Why Lenders Issue Conditions

Underwriters follow a checklist:
- **Income verification**: W-2s, paystubs, tax returns, offer letters
- **Asset verification**: Bank statements, retirement accounts, gifts
- **Employment verification**: Verification of Employment (VOE) from HR
- **Credit history**: Explanations for late payments, judgments, or inquiries
- **Property details**: Appraisal, title report, flood zone determination
- **Compliance**: Debt disclosure, gift letters, earnest money receipts

If anything is missing or unclear, the underwriter issues a condition: **"Send current paystub" or "Explain the $10K transfer from an unknown source."**

### The Broker's Front-Load Strategy

Excellent brokers don't wait for underwriters to ask. They send a **complete, organized package upfront**:

1. **Income documentation (all sources)**
   - Last 2 years of tax returns (personal + business if self-employed)
   - Last 2 months of paystubs (current employer only)
   - Last 2 years of W-2s (bonus: shows 2-year income history)
   - For self-employed: business tax returns, K-1s, profit-and-loss statements
   - For commissioned/bonus: year-to-date totals and last 2 years of bonus history
   - For rental income: Schedule E (tax return), lease agreements, proof of rent deposits

2. **Asset documentation**
   - Last 2 months of bank statements (all accounts—checking, savings, money market)
   - Last 2 months of investment statements (401k, IRA, brokerage, crypto)
   - Proof of down payment source (bank statement showing funds in broker's account)
   - Gift letter (if applicable) + donor's bank statement proving they can gift

3. **Employment verification**
   - VOE form submitted directly by employer to lender
   - Offer letter (if new job within 30 days of closing)
   - Letter from CPA or accountant (for self-employed proving business viability)

4. **Credit management**
   - Written explanation (1–2 sentences) for any late payment, inquiry, or collection
   - Pay stubs showing collections are now current
   - Credit supplement from credit repair service (if applicable)

5. **Property documentation**
   - Purchase agreement (fully executed)
   - Homeowners insurance quote
   - HOA documents (if condo/townhome)
   - Title commitment or abstract
   - Appraisal (once ordered and received)

### The Self-Employed Documentation Deep Dive

Self-employed borrowers face the most conditions because income varies. Brokers who specialize in self-employed have a playbook:

**For manual underwriting (best for self-employed):**
- **2 years of personal and business tax returns** (showing consistent or growing profit)
- **Profit-and-loss statement** for current year (YTD)
- **Business license or EIN confirmation**
- **CPA letter** explaining income stability and business health
- **Bank statements** showing business deposits
- **Accountant's letter** (if 1099 or sole proprietor)

**Why this matters:** Automated underwriting often denies self-employed (DTI assumptions are conservative). Manual underwriters can apply **compensating factors** (higher credit score, larger down payment, strong asset reserves) to approve self-employed files that AUS would reject.

### The Credit Supplement Strategy

Late payments, charge-offs, or credit inquiries often trigger conditions. Brokers use **credit supplements** to explain and resolve:

1. **One-time hardship letters**: "I was laid off in Q2 2024; I missed two payments. I secured new employment in Q3 and have paid on time since September."
2. **Dispute documentation**: If you believe a late payment is reported in error, your broker submits dispute evidence.
3. **Rapid rescores**: Credit bureaus can process disputes in 24–48 hours. A broker coordinating this can update your score before underwriting (sometimes moving you into a better credit tier, which improves rate).

Example: You have a 695 credit score (680–699 tier = +0.75% APR). A rapid rescore moves you to 710 (700–719 tier = +0.50% APR). That 0.25% drop saves $30–50/month on a $300K mortgage.

### AUS Preparation: Clean Runs Matter

Many lenders use **Automated Underwriting Systems (AUS)** like Fannie Mae's Desktop Underwriter or Freddie Mac's Loan Product Advisor. AUS assigns a risk score and issues conditions based on algorithm logic, not human judgment.

Brokers prepare files to **pass AUS with minimal conditions**:

1. **Debt reporting accuracy**: Ensure all debts are reported correctly on credit report. Missing a small credit card? That throws DTI calculations. Broker reconciles credit report vs. actual debts.
2. **Income calculation clarity**: Document exactly which income sources count. W-2 income is straightforward; bonus, commission, and rental need 2 years of history.
3. **Asset reserves**: AUS looks for cash reserves after down payment and closing costs. If you're tight on reserves, a broker might suggest a gift (which doesn't count as liability) or accelerating a bonus to boost assets.
4. **LTV alignment**: If LTV is 95.1% but the program allows 95%, a small increase in down payment clears an LTV condition.

### Documentation Checklist: What to Prepare Before Calling a Broker

Speed up the process—have this ready before you start:

**Income:**
- [ ] Last 2 years of tax returns (personal)
- [ ] Last 2 months of paystubs
- [ ] Last 2 years of W-2s
- [ ] (If self-employed) Last 2 years of business tax returns and YTD P&L

**Assets:**
- [ ] Last 2 months of bank statements (all accounts)
- [ ] Last 2 months of retirement/investment account statements
- [ ] Proof of down payment source (bank statement)
- [ ] (If gift) Gift letter + donor's bank statement

**Employment & Credit:**
- [ ] Offer letter (if job less than 30 days old)
- [ ] Written explanations for late payments or credit inquiries
- [ ] Verification of Employment form (to be filled by employer)

**Property:**
- [ ] Fully executed purchase agreement
- [ ] Copy of earnest money deposit receipt
- [ ] Address and preliminary title report (if available)

### How Long Does It Really Take?

**With strong documentation upfront:**
- Application to pre-approval: 1–2 days
- Pre-approval to clear-to-close: 10–14 days (after appraisal)
- Total time-to-close: 21–28 days (ideal market)

**Without documentation:**
- Every missing item adds 3–7 days per condition
- A file with 5 conditions easily stretches to 45+ days

### Red Flags: Documentation Mistakes Brokers See Often

Brokers tell us these slip-ups delay closings:

1. **Dated bank statements.** Lenders need statements dated within 60 days of closing. Old statements = condition to re-pull.
2. **Inconsistent income dates.** Paystubs from June, W-2s from January, and tax returns from March confuse underwriters. Keep dates consistent.
3. **Missing explanations.** A late payment on credit report without explanation = automatic condition.
4. **Incomplete addresses.** Previous address not listed on documents or mismatched = condition.
5. **Undisclosed debts.** You mention a car loan to the broker but forget to list it on the application. Underwriter finds it via credit—condition for explanation.

### Your Role: Keep Docs Fresh

Once your broker has your file, stay on top of:
- **New paystubs** (lenders often re-pull these 3 days before closing)
- **Explanation updates** (if credit report changes, explain why)
- **Account activity** (large deposits or withdrawals flagged for explanation)
- **Employment changes** (new job or job loss = immediate notice to broker)

### The Bottom Line

Brokers who win on speed and closing cost use documentation as a weapon:
- **Front-load** every document before underwriting asks
- **Organize** by category (income, assets, employment, credit)
- **Explain** every flag proactively
- **Submit updates** (new paystubs, employment verifications) 3 days before closing

This playbook cuts 7–14 days from closing timeline and often saves on lender fees tied to re-pulls and conditions.

**Next step:** Ask your broker: "What documents do you need upfront? I'll have them ready in 24 hours." Clean, organized files close fast.
