title: "About Bad Credit Loan Specialists"
---

Most consumers with bad credit assume they cannot qualify for mortgages until their scores reach 620 or higher. In reality, FHA approves 500+ credit scores through manual underwriting, and non-QM lenders approve recent bankruptcies and foreclosures that traditional banks reject. BadCreditLoanSpecialist.com connects borrowers rebuilding credit to loan officers who specialize in subprime lending and understand how to structure applications for approval despite collections, charge-offs, or past financial hardships.

Bad credit specialists maintain relationships with FHA direct endorsement lenders who approve 500-579 scores (10% down) and 580+ scores (3.5% down), portfolio lenders who manually underwrite challenging files, and non-QM lenders offering alternative documentation loans. They pre-qualify borrowers by analyzing [credit score ranges](https://middlecreditscore.com), compensating factors, and waiting periods—maximizing approval odds before formal applications that trigger hard inquiries and potential denials.
