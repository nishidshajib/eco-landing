## The Jumbo Lending Fork: Portfolio vs. Agency

When you apply for a Texas jumbo loan (above $766,550 conforming limit), you'll encounter two fundamentally different lender types: **portfolio lenders** and **agency jumbo lenders**. The difference isn't just branding—it dictates underwriting flexibility, rate pricing, and whether complex income (self-employed, foreign national, asset-based) gets approved or denied.

**Portfolio lenders** (credit unions, private banks, regional banks) hold jumbo loans on their balance sheet instead of selling them to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or mortgage-backed security investors. This gives them **underwriting freedom**—manual approval for compensating factors, bank statement income, asset depletion, and non-standard scenarios that agency guidelines would auto-reject.

**Agency jumbo lenders** originate high-balance conforming loans (in high-cost areas) or jumbo loans that meet **Fannie/Freddie jumbo criteria**, then sell them to agencies or investors. These lenders follow **rigid guidelines**—automated underwriting (DU/LP), strict DTI caps, W-2 income preference, and limited compensating factor flexibility. If your file doesn't check every box, automated underwriting declines it—even if your financial profile is strong.

### Why This Matters for Texas Jumbo Borrowers

**Self-employed with K-1 income?** Agency jumbo underwrites 2 years of tax returns with strict add-backs; portfolio lenders can use **12–24 months of bank statements** or **asset-based underwriting**.

**Foreign national with no U.S. credit?** Agency jumbo requires U.S. credit history; portfolio lenders approve **foreign national jumbo programs** with passport, visa, and down payment (no U.S. credit).

**High-net-worth with complex income (rentals, investments, business ownership)?** Agency jumbo calculates income by rigid IRS guidelines (Schedule E losses reduce income); portfolio lenders can **manually underwrite** based on cash flow, asset strength, and compensating factors.

**Clean W-2 income, 760 credit, 25% down?** Agency jumbo may offer **lower rates** than portfolio—agencies buy loans in bulk, achieving economies of scale that small portfolio lenders can't match.

Understanding portfolio vs. agency **determines which lenders you shop**—and which loan structures make sense for your financial profile.

## What Is a Portfolio Lender?

Portfolio lenders originate jumbo loans and **hold them as assets** on their balance sheet instead of selling to secondary markets. Think:
- **Credit unions** (Navy Federal, PenFed, local Texas credit unions)
- **Private banks** (Northern Trust, J.P. Morgan Private Bank, UBS, Citi Private Bank)
- **Regional banks** (Frost Bank, Texas Capital Bank, Comerica)
- **Community banks** (local Texas banks with jumbo lending programs)

Because they hold loans **long-term** (5–30 years), portfolio lenders earn profit from **interest income and servicing**—not from origination fees and loan sales. This business model allows:

### **Manual Underwriting**
Portfolio lenders can approve loans that fail automated underwriting (DU/LP) by evaluating **compensating factors**:
- High credit score (760+) offsetting 50% DTI
- Large cash reserves (18 months PITI) offsetting self-employment volatility
- Low LTV (70%) offsetting bank statement income documentation
- Strong deposit relationships (private banking clients)

**Example**: Self-employed borrower with $1.5M loan, 45% DTI, 740 credit, $300K reserves, 25% down. Agency jumbo: ❌ **Auto-decline** (DTI too high, self-employment risk). Portfolio lender: ✅ **Manual approval** (strong reserves, low LTV, credit tier).

### **Bank Statement Income Programs**
Self-employed borrowers can qualify using **12–24 months of business/personal bank deposits** instead of tax returns. Lender calculates average monthly deposits, applies 50%–75% income factor (to account for business expenses), and underwrites based on that "grossed-up" income.

**Example**: $40K average monthly deposits × 60% = $24K qualifying income (vs. $15K shown on tax returns after deductions). Portfolio lender can approve jumbo at higher loan amount than agency jumbo.

### **Asset-Based & Asset Depletion Programs**
High-net-worth borrowers with **substantial liquid assets** ($2M+) can qualify via **asset depletion**: lender divides total assets by loan term (360 months), treats result as monthly income.

**Example**: Borrower has $3M liquid assets, applies for $1.5M jumbo. Asset depletion income: $3M ÷ 360 = $8,333/month. If PITI is $10K/month, borrower qualifies (DTI ~120%, but assets cover payments for 25+ years). **Agency jumbo doesn't offer this**—requires traditional income calculation.

### **Foreign National & Non-Resident Programs**
Portfolio lenders approve **foreign nationals** (no U.S. credit, no Social Security number) with:
- Passport, visa, and foreign credit report
- 30%–40% down payment
- Higher reserve requirements (18–24 months PITI)
- Larger loan amounts than most expect ($1M–$5M+)

**Agency jumbo**: Requires U.S. credit history, Social Security number, and W-2/tax return income. **Foreign nationals cannot qualify**.

## What Is an Agency Jumbo Lender?

Agency jumbo lenders originate loans that meet **Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac high-balance conforming guidelines** (in high-cost areas) or **jumbo loans sold to private investors** under strict underwriting criteria. These lenders:

- Use **automated underwriting** (Desktop Underwriter, Loan Prospector)
- Follow **rigid DTI caps** (43%–45% max, rarely exceeded)
- Prefer **W-2 income** (salaried, documented, verified by VOE)
- Require **U.S. credit history** (no foreign national programs)
- Limit compensating factors (high reserves or low LTV rarely override high DTI)

### **Pros of Agency Jumbo**
1. **Lower rates (sometimes)**: Agencies buy jumbo loans in bulk, achieving pricing efficiencies. If you have pristine credit (760+), W-2 income, and low DTI (35%), agency jumbo may beat portfolio rates by 0.125%–0.375%.
2. **Faster automated approvals**: DU/LP approval in seconds if your file checks all boxes.
3. **National lender access**: Most large banks, online lenders, and mortgage brokers offer agency jumbo—easier to shop rates.

### **Cons of Agency Jumbo**
1. **No flexibility for complex income**: Self-employed, K-1 income, asset-based, or foreign national borrowers get auto-declined.
2. **Strict DTI limits**: 43%–45% max DTI with minimal compensating factor exceptions.
3. **Rigid reserve requirements**: No manual underwriting to reduce reserve requirements based on strong credit or low LTV.
4. **U.S. credit required**: No foreign national programs, no alternative credit (rent history, utilities) accepted.

## When to Choose Portfolio Lenders

Choose **portfolio lenders** if you:

### **1. Are Self-Employed or Have Complex Income**
- Tax returns show low income due to deductions, but bank statements show strong cash flow.
- K-1 income from partnerships, LLCs, or S-corps with losses that reduce qualifying income.
- Multiple income sources (rentals, investments, business ownership) that confuse automated underwriting.

**Portfolio lender advantage**: Bank statement programs, asset-based underwriting, manual income calculation.

### **2. Are a Foreign National or Non-Resident**
- No U.S. credit history or Social Security number.
- Purchasing U.S. property for investment, vacation home, or primary residence (with visa).

**Portfolio lender advantage**: Foreign national jumbo programs with passport/visa approval.

### **3. Have High DTI but Strong Compensating Factors**
- DTI 47%–55%, but 760+ credit, $500K reserves, 25% down.
- Agency jumbo auto-declines; portfolio lender manually approves.

**Portfolio lender advantage**: Manual underwriting weighs compensating factors.

### **4. Need Relationship Banking Perks**
- Moving $2M+ in deposits, investment accounts, or retirement assets to private bank.
- Want rate discounts, appraisal fee waivers, or closing cost credits for banking relationship.

**Portfolio lender advantage**: Private banks reward relationships with pricing concessions.

### **5. Want Flexibility for Unique Property Types**
- Non-warrantable condos, co-ops, or properties that don't meet agency guidelines.
- Portfolio lenders can approve manually if property appraises and location is acceptable.

**Agency jumbo advantage**: Economies of scale drive better pricing for pristine files.

### **2. Want National Lender Competition**
- Most large banks, online lenders, and brokers offer agency jumbo—easier to shop 5–10 lenders for best rate.

**Agency jumbo advantage**: More lenders = more rate shopping.

## Portfolio Lender Rate Myths: Are They Always More Expensive?

**Common myth**: Portfolio lenders charge higher rates because they hold loans (can't sell to agencies for arbitrage profit).

**Reality**: Portfolio lenders **can** offer competitive—or better—rates than agency jumbo for strong profiles:

### **Private Banking Discounts**
If you move $1M+ in deposits or investment accounts to J.P. Morgan Private Bank, Citi Private Bank, or Northern Trust, you may get **relationship pricing**: 0.25%–0.50% rate discount vs. retail jumbo.

### **Credit Union Pricing**
Navy Federal, PenFed, and large Texas credit unions (e.g., TDECU, Randolph-Brooks FCU) often beat agency jumbo rates for members with strong credit and deposits.

### **Manual Underwriting = Pricing Flexibility**
Portfolio lenders can price based on **compensating factors**: 780 credit, $800K reserves, 30% down? Lender may offer same rate as agency jumbo despite 48% DTI (agency would auto-decline).

### **When Portfolio Costs More**
If you're **high-risk** (self-employed with inconsistent income, 700 credit, 10% down, 50% DTI), portfolio lenders price for risk: 0.50%–1.00% higher than agency jumbo for clean W-2 borrowers. **But agency wouldn't approve you at all**—so comparison is moot.
