## Why Texas Jumbo Borrowers Need Specialized Lenders

Jumbo loans in Texas start at $766,550 (2025 conforming limit). Above that threshold, you're navigating portfolio lenders, private banks, and specialty programs with underwriting that agency lenders can't match. Self-employed? Foreign national? Complex income? Portfolio lenders hold loans instead of selling them—enabling manual underwriting, bank statement income, and asset-based approval that rigid agency guidelines reject.

The challenge: most borrowers shop only 1–2 jumbo lenders and miss better rates, flexible terms, and reserve-friendly programs. Portfolio lenders compete aggressively in Texas luxury markets (Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio). Shopping 3–4 lenders uncovers relationship pricing, private banking discounts, and compensating factor flexibility that saves thousands monthly on million-dollar loans.
