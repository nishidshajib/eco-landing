# Conforming vs. Non-Conforming: How 2025 Loan Limits Shape Your Conventional Mortgage Options

Understanding the difference between conforming and non-conforming loans is crucial for making the right mortgage decision in 2025. With updated FHFA loan limits and evolving market conditions, borrowers must navigate an increasingly complex landscape to secure the best financing for their specific situation.

## Defining Conforming vs. Non-Conforming Loans

**Key characteristics:**

- **Standardized underwriting** guidelines and criteria
- **Government backing** through GSE purchase  
- **Uniform documentation** and qualification requirements
- **Consistent servicing** standards and borrower protections

### Non-Conforming Loans: Alternative Financing
**Non-conforming loans fall outside GSE guidelines and include:**

**Jumbo loans** (exceed conforming loan limits)
**Portfolio loans** (kept by lender, don't meet GSE standards)
**Non-QM loans** (non-qualified mortgage products)
**Bank statement** loans and alternative documentation
**Investment property** specialized programs
