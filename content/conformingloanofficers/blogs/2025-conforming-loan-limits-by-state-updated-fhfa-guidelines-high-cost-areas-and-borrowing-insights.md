Every year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announces new conforming loan limits—the maximum loan amounts that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase from lenders. For 2025, the baseline conforming loan limit is **$766,550** for single-family homes in most counties, with high-cost areas reaching up to **$1,149,825**. Understanding these limits by state and county is essential for determining whether you need conforming, high-balance conforming, or jumbo financing—and how your loan amount affects rate eligibility and approval odds.

In this guide, we'll break down 2025 conforming loan limits by state, explain high-cost area exceptions, and show you how to use these limits to make smarter borrowing decisions.

## What Are Conforming Loan Limits?

**Conforming loan limits** are the maximum loan amounts that meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards. Loans within these limits (and meeting underwriting guidelines) can be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises, which allows lenders to offer lower rates and easier qualification than non-conforming or jumbo loans.

The FHFA adjusts these limits annually based on changes in average home prices. For 2025, the baseline limit increased from $766,550 to reflect rising home values nationwide.

## 2025 Baseline Conforming Loan Limits

For most counties in the United States, the 2025 conforming loan limits are:

- **Single-Family Home:** $766,550
- **Two-Unit Property:** $981,500
- **Three-Unit Property:** $1,186,350
- **Four-Unit Property:** $1,474,400

These limits apply to counties where median home prices are below the FHFA's high-cost threshold. If you're buying within these limits, you qualify for standard conforming loan rates—which are typically the most competitive mortgage rates available.

## High-Cost Area Conforming Loan Limits

In designated high-cost areas—counties where median home prices exceed 115% of the national median—conforming loan limits are higher. For 2025, the maximum high-cost area limits are:

- **Single-Family Home:** $1,149,825
- **Two-Unit Property:** $1,472,250
- **Three-Unit Property:** $1,779,525
- **Four-Unit Property:** $2,211,600

High-cost counties include many parts of California, New York, Washington, Hawaii, Alaska, and other expensive metro areas. Loans within these higher limits are called **high-balance conforming loans**—they still meet Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac standards but require slightly stricter qualification (often higher credit scores and reserves).

## Conforming Loan Limits by State (2025 Highlights)

While every county has its own specific limit, here are some notable state-level highlights for 2025:

### California
California has the most high-cost counties in the nation. Counties like San Francisco, Santa Clara, Marin, San Mateo, and Orange have conforming limits at or near $1,149,825. Meanwhile, inland counties like Kern or San Joaquin use the baseline $766,550 limit.

### New York
New York City boroughs (Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx) and Westchester County have high-cost limits reaching $1,149,825. Upstate counties generally use the baseline limit.

### Washington
King County (Seattle), Snohomish County, and Pierce County have high-balance limits above the baseline, with King County reaching $1,019,500 for single-family homes.

### Hawaii
All Hawaiian counties—Honolulu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai—have high-cost limits at or near $1,149,825 due to elevated home prices.

### Florida
Most Florida counties use the baseline $766,550 limit, but Monroe County (Florida Keys) has a high-cost limit of $1,149,825.

### Texas
Texas counties primarily use the baseline limit, though some metro areas like Austin or Dallas may have slightly higher limits depending on FHFA's annual analysis.

### Colorado
Counties like Boulder, Denver, and Summit have high-balance limits above the baseline due to strong housing markets.

## How Conforming Loan Limits Affect Your Borrowing Power

Understanding your county's conforming loan limit helps you determine:

- **Whether you need a jumbo loan:** If your loan amount exceeds the conforming limit, you'll need jumbo financing—which typically requires higher credit scores, larger down payments, and higher interest rates.

- **Rate eligibility:** Loans within conforming limits qualify for the best rates. High-balance conforming loans have slightly higher rates than baseline conforming loans but still beat jumbo rates.

- **Down payment strategies:** If you're $10,000 or $20,000 over the conforming limit, increasing your down payment to stay within conforming limits can save thousands in interest over the life of the loan.

- **Qualification standards:** Conforming loans have standardized underwriting. Non-conforming loans vary by lender and often require more documentation and reserves.

## Real-Life Example: Understanding Your County Limit

Let's say you're buying a home in San Diego County, California, where the 2025 conforming loan limit is $1,149,825. You're looking at a $1.1 million home with 10% down, which means you need a $990,000 loan.

Because $990,000 is under the $1,149,825 limit, you qualify for a **high-balance conforming loan**—not a jumbo loan. This saves you approximately 0.25% to 0.75% on your interest rate compared to jumbo financing, which translates to tens of thousands of dollars in savings over 30 years.

However, if you were buying the same home in Riverside County (baseline limit $766,550), that $990,000 loan would be considered jumbo—requiring stricter qualification and higher rates.

## Conforming Loan Limits and Credit Scores

Your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> plays a major role in conforming loan eligibility and pricing. Even if your loan amount is within conforming limits, lenders apply **loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs)** based on your credit score and LTV ratio.

For high-balance conforming loans, lenders often require:

- **Minimum 700 credit score** for competitive rates
- **740+ for the best pricing** on high-balance loans
- **Additional reserves** (6+ months of payments in savings)

If your credit score is below 700, you may still qualify for baseline conforming loans (limits under $766,550) with slightly higher rates. Understanding these thresholds before applying helps you set realistic expectations and improve your qualifications if needed.

## How to Check Your County's Conforming Loan Limit

To find your county's specific 2025 conforming loan limit:

1. **Visit the FHFA's official loan limit page** – Search "FHFA conforming loan limits 2025" and use their interactive county lookup tool.

2. **Check with Browse Lenders** – Verified loan officers on <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> can provide your county's exact limit and explain how it affects your borrowing power.

3. **Ask your lender** – Any licensed loan officer should be able to tell you the conforming loan limit for your county.

Knowing this number before you start house hunting helps you set realistic price ranges and avoid accidentally shopping for homes that would require jumbo financing.

## Conforming vs High-Balance Conforming vs Jumbo Loans

Understanding the differences between these three loan types helps you plan your financing strategy:

| Loan Type | Loan Amount | Rate Comparison | Qualification |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Baseline Conforming** | Up to $766,550 | Best rates available | Standard credit/DTI requirements |
| **High-Balance Conforming** | $766,551 to $1,149,825 (high-cost counties) | Slightly higher than baseline, still competitive | Higher credit score, more reserves |
| **Jumbo** | Above conforming limit | 0.25%-0.75% higher than conforming | Stricter underwriting, larger down payments |

If you're on the edge of the conforming limit, increasing your down payment to stay within conforming limits can unlock better rates and easier qualification.

## What If You're Over the Conforming Limit?

If your loan amount exceeds your county's conforming limit, you have several options:

1. **Increase your down payment** – Bring more cash to closing to reduce your loan amount below the conforming limit.

2. **Consider a piggyback loan** – Use an 80/10/10 or 80/15/5 structure to keep your first mortgage within conforming limits while using a second loan for the remainder.

3. **Accept jumbo financing** – If you have strong credit (740+), significant reserves, and stable income, jumbo loans may still be competitive—especially in high-demand markets.

4. **Explore cash-out refinance options** – If you're refinancing an existing property, <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> strategies may help you stay within conforming limits while accessing equity.

## Why Conforming Loan Limits Matter for 2025

Rising home prices mean more buyers are bumping up against conforming loan limits—especially in high-cost areas. Understanding these limits helps you:

- **Plan your home search** within a realistic price range
- **Maximize your borrowing power** by staying within conforming limits
- **Avoid surprise jumbo financing** that requires stricter qualification
- **Compare rate scenarios** (conforming vs high-balance vs jumbo) before committing

The FHFA's annual adjustments reflect housing market trends, and 2025's increase to $766,550 baseline provides more borrowing power for buyers in standard-cost counties.
