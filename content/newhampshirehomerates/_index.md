New Hampshire mortgage rates shift with **seasonal market dynamics** and **regional lender competition**. Portsmouth and Manchester markets typically have more lender options than northern counties, but brokers provide statewide access to wholesale pricing.

Spring and summer buying seasons often create **tighter pricing** as lender volume increases and competition intensifies. Winter markets slow, and rates may widen slightly. Understanding these patterns helps New Hampshire buyers time locks strategically.

**APR matters more than advertised rates** in New Hampshire. Lenders charge varying origination fees ($1,000–$3,000), and comparing APR reveals true borrowing costs. A 0.125% APR difference can cost $3,000+ over five years on a typical NH mortgage.
