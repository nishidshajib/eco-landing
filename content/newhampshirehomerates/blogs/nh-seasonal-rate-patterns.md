New Hampshire's housing market follows a **predictable seasonal rhythm** that directly impacts mortgage rate pricing and lender competition.

## Spring/Summer Rate Compression

April through August typically brings **tighter rate pricing** in New Hampshire:

- **Volume increase**: More buyers = more lender volume = better pricing capacity
- **Competition intensifies**: Lenders compete harder when pipeline volume supports aggressive pricing
- **Secondary market liquidity**: Higher national origination volumes improve bond market conditions

A typical Manchester purchase in May might see rates 0.125%–0.25% better than January for the same borrower profile, simply due to seasonal pricing dynamics.

## Winter Rate Widening

November through February often shows **slightly wider pricing**:

- **Volume decline**: Fewer buyers = less lender volume = reduced pricing power
- **Competition softens**: Some lenders pull back on aggressive pricing when pipelines shrink
- **Holiday disruptions**: Year-end and early January can see temporary pricing volatility

This doesn't mean winter rates are always worse—national Fed policy and bond market trends matter more—but seasonal patterns create modest local pricing pressure.

## New Hampshire Regional Variations

Coastal markets (Portsmouth, Dover, Hampton) see **less seasonal volatility** than northern counties:

- Year-round buyer activity in southern NH stabilizes lender volume
- Northern lakes and ski markets have sharper seasonal swings
- Manchester/Concord fall between coastal and northern patterns

## Lock Timing Strategy

Understanding New Hampshire's seasonal patterns helps with **lock timing decisions**:

- **Spring buyers**: Consider floating if early in escrow—rates may improve as season peaks
- **Winter buyers**: Lock quickly if rate is acceptable—seasonal pressure works against you
- **Lakes/northern buyers**: Pay extra attention to seasonal cycles in resort markets

## APR Matters More Than Seasonal Swings

While seasonal rate differences exist, **fee variations matter more**:

- Seasonal rate swings: typically 0.125%–0.25%
- Lender fee differences: $1,000–$3,000 (equivalent to 0.25%–0.50% APR on a $400k loan)

Focus on **comparing APR across lenders** within any season rather than trying to perfectly time seasonal rate cycles.

## Tracking New Hampshire Rate Trends

Monitor these signals for New Hampshire rate timing:

1. **National bond yields**: 10-year Treasury drives most rate movement
2. **Local lender volume**: Ask loan officers if their pipeline is busy (busy = tighter pricing)
3. **MLS pending sales data**: Rising pendings often precede rate competition
4. **Fed policy statements**: Rate policy changes override seasonal patterns

New Hampshire's seasonal rate patterns are real but modest—typically less impactful than choosing the right lender with transparent APR pricing.
