New Hampshire borrowers often focus on **advertised interest rates** while ignoring APR—the metric that reveals true borrowing costs by including lender fees.

## What APR Includes

APR (Annual Percentage Rate) accounts for:

- **Base interest rate**: The note rate you pay monthly
- **Origination fees**: Points, underwriting, processing charges
- **Broker compensation**: If using a mortgage broker
- **Certain closing costs**: Some lender-imposed fees (not third-party title/escrow)

APR does **not** include:

- Title insurance, attorney fees, recording charges
- Homeowners insurance, property taxes, HOA dues
- Appraisal, credit report, or inspection fees

## New Hampshire APR Example

Compare these two Portsmouth lender quotes on a $450,000 purchase:

**Lender A:**
- Rate: 6.500%
- Origination fee: $3,000
- APR: 6.668%

**Lender B:**
- Rate: 6.625%
- Origination fee: $1,000
- APR: 6.701%

Despite Lender A's lower rate, **Lender B costs less** if you hold the loan 5+ years:

- Year 1 difference: Lender A saves ~$300 in interest but costs $2,000 more in fees = $1,700 worse
- Year 5 cumulative: Lender A still behind by ~$1,200
- Year 7 cumulative: Break-even point
- Year 10+: Lender A pulls ahead

Most New Hampshire borrowers refinance or move within 7 years—making Lender B the better deal despite the higher rate.

## Common APR Tricks in New Hampshire

Watch for these in Manchester, Nashua, or statewide markets:

### 1. "No Fee" Loans at Higher Rates

Some lenders advertise "zero fees" by inflating the rate enough to cover origination costs via lender credits:

- Base market rate: 6.500%
- "No fee" rate: 7.000% (0.500% higher)
- Value of lender credit: ~$4,500 on $450k loan

This works if you **plan to refinance within 3 years**—but costs more long-term than paying modest fees upfront.

### 2. Discount Points Manipulation

Some quotes show "low rates" by including discount points (prepaid interest):

- Rate: 6.250% **with 1.5 points** ($6,750 on $450k)
- APR: 6.524%

Compare to a no-point option at 6.500%/6.568% APR—the point-buy often doesn't pay off unless you hold the loan 8+ years.

### 3. Hiding Fees in APR Disclosure

Lenders must disclose APR, but some bury high fees in fine print:

- Advertised rate: 6.375%
- Origination fee: $2,500
- "Processing fee": $1,200
- "Underwriting fee": $900
- Total fees: $4,600 (APR jumps to 6.662%)

Always ask for **itemized Loan Estimate** rather than trusting advertised APR.

## New Hampshire Regional APR Variations

Fee structures vary across NH markets:

**Portsmouth/Seacoast:**
- More lender competition = lower typical fees ($1,000–$2,000)
- Credit unions often have lowest APR

**Manchester/Concord:**
- Moderate fee range ($1,500–$2,500)
- Brokers provide good wholesale access

**Northern/Lakes Region:**
- Fewer local lenders = potentially higher fees ($2,000–$3,000)
- Brokers especially valuable for accessing competitive APR

## How to Compare APR Correctly

Follow this process when evaluating New Hampshire lenders:

1. **Get Loan Estimates from 3–5 lenders** (banks, brokers, credit unions)
2. **Compare APR on identical loan amounts** ($450k vs $450k, not $450k vs $455k)
3. **Verify APR includes all lender fees** (ask "are there any fees not included in this APR?")
4. **Consider your time horizon**:
   - Refinance within 3–5 years: Accept higher rate for lower fees
   - Keep loan 7+ years: Pay modest points for lower rate
   - Unsure: Split the difference with mid-range fees/rate

5. **Check rate lock terms**: 30-day, 45-day, or 60-day locks have different pricing

## NH Credit Union APR Advantage

New Hampshire credit unions often offer **lowest APR** due to non-profit structure:

- Service Credit Union (Portsmouth)
- St. Mary's Bank (Manchester)
- Granite State Credit Union (statewide)

Typical APR advantage: 0.10%–0.25% below bank/broker pricing on conventional loans.

## When APR Doesn't Matter

APR comparison is less useful for:

- **ARM loans**: APR calculation assumes worst-case rate adjustments (unrealistic)
- **Temporary financing**: If you know you'll refinance within 1–2 years
- **Non-QM loans**: High fees for portfolio underwriting can inflate APR despite competitive rates

For these scenarios, focus on **total out-of-pocket costs** rather than APR.

## New Hampshire APR Tracking

Ask every lender:

1. "What's the APR on this loan?"
2. "What fees are included in the APR calculation?"
3. "Are there any lender fees not reflected in APR?"
4. "Can you provide a Loan Estimate for comparison?"

Use **APR as the primary comparison metric** across New Hampshire lenders, and you'll avoid overpaying thousands in hidden fees disguised by attractive advertised rates.
