My cash-out refinance for debt consolidation saved me $712/month in total payments. That sounds amazing, right?

But here's what the headlines don't tell you: **My mortgage payment increased from $1,345 to $2,180—a $835/month jump.**

Wait, how do I save $712/month if my mortgage increased by $835/month? And is taking on a higher mortgage payment worth eliminating high-interest debt?

Here's the complete math behind my $52,000 debt consolidation through cash-out refi, including the payment tradeoff, total interest savings, credit score improvement, and whether I'd do it again.

## My Debt Situation Before Cash-Out Refi

**High-interest debt:**
- Credit card 1: $19,400 at 24.99% → $485/month minimum
- Credit card 2: $16,800 at 22.49% → $420/month minimum
- Credit card 3: $9,200 at 19.99% → $230/month minimum
- Personal loan 1: $4,600 at 16.5% → $155/month minimum
- Personal loan 2: $2,000 at 18.99% → $72/month minimum
- **Total debt: $52,000**
- **Average interest rate: 22.4%**
- **Monthly minimum payments: $1,362**
- **Annual interest cost: $11,648**

This debt was suffocating. At minimum payments, I'd be debt-free in 6.2 years but would pay **$38,900 in total interest**—that's 75% more than the $52,000 principal I borrowed.

I was throwing $11,648/year into the credit card company's pockets while barely making progress on principal. Something had to change.

**Home equity position:**
- Home value: $425,000
- Current mortgage: $285,000 at 3.875% (locked in 2020)
- Current mortgage payment: $1,345/month (P&I)
- Remaining term: 25 years
- Equity: $140,000 (33%)

I had enough equity for cash-out refinance debt consolidation. The question was: would it actually save me money despite increasing my mortgage payment?

## Cash-Out Refi Quote and New Loan Terms

I got quotes from three lenders through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a>:

**Best cash-out refi quote:**
- New loan amount: $337,000 (includes $52K debt payoff)
- Interest rate: 6.75%
- New mortgage payment: $2,180/month (P&I)
- Closing costs: $10,100
- Term: 30 years
- Credit score requirement: 660+ (I had 689)

**Immediate payment impact:**
- Old mortgage payment: $1,345/month
- New mortgage payment: $2,180/month
- **Mortgage payment increase: $835/month**

This is where most people panic. My mortgage payment increased by $835/month—62% higher than my previous payment. That feels scary.

But here's what changed with debt elimination:

**Total monthly obligations before:**
- Mortgage: $1,345/month
- Debt payments: $1,362/month
- **Total: $2,707/month**

**Total monthly obligations after cash-out refi:**
- New mortgage: $2,180/month
- Debt payments: $0/month
- **Total: $2,180/month**

**Net monthly savings: $2,707 - $2,180 = $527/month**

Wait, I said I saved $712/month in the title. What's the difference?

The $527/month is my savings on minimum payments. But I was actually paying more than minimums—I was paying $1,547/month total toward debt (extra $185/month toward highest-rate card) trying to get ahead.

**Total monthly obligations with my actual payments:**
- Mortgage: $1,345/month
- Debt payments (with extra): $1,547/month
- **Total: $2,892/month**

**Actual net monthly savings: $2,892 - $2,180 = $712/month**

So yes, my mortgage payment increased by $835/month, but I eliminated $1,547/month in debt payments, resulting in a net savings of $712/month in my monthly budget.

## The Payment Tradeoff: Mortgage Increase vs Debt Elimination

Here's the breakdown of what changed:

**What I lost:**
- Low 3.875% mortgage rate replaced with 6.75% (2.875% increase)
- Mortgage payment increased $835/month
- Additional $52,000 added to mortgage principal
- Paid $10,100 in closing costs

**What I gained:**
- Eliminated $1,547/month in debt payments (including extra payments)
- Net cash flow improvement: $712/month
- Eliminated $11,648/year in credit card interest
- Consolidated to one single payment
- Fixed rate on debt (credit cards were variable and increasing)
- Reduced total interest paid by $143,200 over 5 years (see calculations below)

The tradeoff was clear: **Higher mortgage payment, but dramatically lower total monthly obligations and massive interest savings.**

## Total Interest Comparison: Old Debt vs Cash-Out Refi

Let me show you the full interest cost comparison over 5 years:

### Scenario A: Keep Current Debt (Pay Off in 5 Years with Extra Payments)

To pay off $52,000 debt in 5 years at 22.4% average rate:
- Required monthly payment: $1,465/month toward debt
- Total interest paid on debt: $35,900
- Mortgage interest (5 years at 3.875%): $53,800
- **Total interest: $89,700**

### Scenario B: Cash-Out Refi at 6.75%

With cash-out refi consolidating all debt:
- Monthly payment: $2,180/month (mortgage only)
- Total interest on new $337K loan (5 years): $110,200
- Less closing costs: $10,100
- **Total interest: $100,100**

Wait—cash-out refi costs me MORE interest ($100,100 vs $89,700)? How is that saving money?

Here's the catch: In Scenario A, I assumed I could afford $1,465/month toward debt plus $1,345 mortgage = $2,810/month total. That's $630/month MORE than the $2,180 cash-out refi payment.

**More realistic comparison: What if I can only afford $2,180/month total?**

### Scenario A (Realistic): Keep Current Debt, Pay What I Can Afford

If I keep debt and allocate the same $2,180/month I'd pay with cash-out refi:
- Mortgage payment: $1,345/month
- Available for debt: $2,180 - $1,345 = $835/month
- Time to pay off $52K debt at $835/month: **8.4 years** (not 5 years)
- Total interest paid on debt (8.4 years): $67,800
- Mortgage interest (8.4 years): $90,400
- **Total interest: $158,200**

### Scenario B: Cash-Out Refi at 6.75%

- Monthly payment: $2,180/month
- Total interest (8.4 years): $186,900
- Closing costs: $10,100
- **Total interest: $177,000**

Even in this comparison, cash-out refi costs slightly more interest ($177,000 vs $158,200 = $18,800 more).

**So why did I choose cash-out refi if it costs more interest?**

## Why I Chose Cash-Out Refi Despite Higher Interest Cost

The total interest calculations alone don't tell the full story. Here's why cash-out refi was the right choice for me:

**1. Predictable Fixed Payment**
- Old situation: Variable credit card rates were increasing (went from 19% avg to 22.4% in 2 years)
- Cash-out refi: Fixed 6.75% rate for 30 years (payment never changes)
- Peace of mind knowing my payment won't increase

**2. Credit Score Improvement**
- Before: 689 credit score with 78% credit utilization
- After 6 months: 738 credit score with 2% utilization
- 49-point credit score jump opened up better financial options
- Improved my <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> dramatically

**3. Simplified Financial Management**
- Before: Managing 5 separate debt payments across different due dates
- After: One single mortgage payment each month
- Reduced stress and mental burden significantly

**4. Debt Couldn't Be Discharged in Bankruptcy**
- Credit card debt would survive bankruptcy (unsecured)
- Mortgage is secured by home but provides bankruptcy protection for other assets
- Better risk management (though I hope to never use this)

**5. Tax Deduction on Interest**
- Mortgage interest is tax-deductible (consult tax advisor)
- Credit card interest is NOT deductible
- Effective after-tax rate on mortgage is lower than stated 6.75%

**6. Freed Up Credit for Emergencies**
- Before: $52,000 credit card debt, $0 available credit
- After: $0 debt, $52,000 available credit if emergency arises
- Psychological safety net (though I won't use it for non-emergencies)

**7. No More Rate Increases**
- Credit card rates were climbing (went from 19% → 22.4% in 2 years)
- If rates continued increasing to 25-27%, my interest cost would explode
- Fixed 6.75% rate locks in predictable cost

The higher total interest cost ($18,800 more over 8.4 years) was worth these benefits—especially the credit score improvement, payment predictability, and reduced financial stress.

## Monthly Budget Impact: Real Numbers

Here's what changed in my actual monthly budget:

**Before cash-out refi:**
- Mortgage: $1,345
- Credit card 1: $485 (often paid $600 with extra)
- Credit card 2: $420 (often paid $500 with extra)
- Credit card 3: $230
- Personal loan 1: $155
- Personal loan 2: $72
- **Total: $2,707 minimum ($2,892 with my extra payments)**

**After cash-out refi:**
- Mortgage: $2,180
- All debt: $0
- **Total: $2,180**

**Net monthly savings: $712/month**

**What I did with $712/month savings:**
- Emergency fund: $300/month (building 6-month reserve)
- Extra mortgage principal: $200/month (paying down faster)
- Retirement 401k increase: $150/month (from 4% to 7% contribution)
- Quality of life: $62/month (occasional dinner out, guilt-free)

The $712/month freed up isn't just sitting in checking. I redirected it to financial priorities (emergency fund, retirement) while also improving quality of life slightly.

## 6-Month Results: Was It Worth It?

**6 months after cash-out refi:**

- New mortgage balance: $335,200 (paid down $1,800 with extra principal payments)
- Total interest paid: $11,200
- Monthly payment: $2,180 (unchanged, fixed)
- Credit score: 689 → 738 (49-point jump)
- Emergency fund: $1,800 saved (6 months × $300/month)
- Credit utilization: 78% → 2%
- Available credit: $0 → $52,000 (though not planning to use)
- Financial stress level: 8/10 → 3/10

**If I'd kept the debt:**
- Remaining debt: $47,400 (paid down $4,600 at $835/month)
- Total interest paid: $10,900 on debt + $4,900 on mortgage = $15,800
- Credit score: Likely still 689-695 with high utilization
- Financial stress: Still 8/10

The cash-out refi eliminated my high-interest debt, improved my credit 49 points, and gave me mental peace. My mortgage payment is $835 higher, but my total monthly obligations are $712 lower, and I'm building an emergency fund for the first time in years.

**Was the higher mortgage payment worth it? Absolutely yes.**

## When Higher Mortgage Payment Makes Sense

Cash-out refi with higher mortgage payment makes sense when:

**1. Your debt interest rates are 12%+**
- High-interest debt (credit cards 18-25%) makes cash-out refi worth it
- Low-interest debt (car loan at 4%) doesn't justify cash-out refi
- My 22.4% average rate made consolidation a no-brainer

**2. Total monthly obligations decrease**
- Even if mortgage increases, total payments should decrease
- My total dropped from $2,892 to $2,180 = $712/month savings
- Calculate: (Old mortgage + Old debt payments) vs (New mortgage)

**3. You're making only minimum payments on debt**
- Minimum payments barely touch principal on high-interest debt
- My $52K debt would take 6.2 years at minimums (paying $38,900 interest)
- Cash-out refi accelerates debt elimination dramatically

**4. Credit card rates are variable and increasing**
- My rates went from 19% → 22.4% in 2 years
- Future increases could push rates to 25-27%+
- Fixed mortgage rate provides protection against rate increases

**5. You have 20%+ home equity**
- I had 33% equity ($140K in $425K home)
- Need sufficient equity to consolidate debt while staying under 80% LTV
- Low equity (under 15%) makes cash-out refi difficult or expensive

**6. Your credit score is 660+**
- My 689 score qualified for 6.75% rate
- Lower scores (620-659) might get 7.5-8.5%+ rates
- Higher scores (720+) could get better rates (6.25-6.5%)

## When to Avoid Cash-Out Refi (Keep Debt Separate)

Don't do cash-out refi if:

**1. Your current mortgage rate is under 4% and new rate is 6.5%+**
- I had 3.875% replaced with 6.75% (2.875% increase)
- This increased my interest cost on the existing mortgage balance
- Consider <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">HELOC instead to preserve low first mortgage rate</a>

**2. Your debt is small relative to mortgage (under 15% of balance)**
- My $52K debt was 18% of $285K mortgage
- Small debt amounts don't justify losing low mortgage rate
- Better to use personal loan or aggressive payoff plan

**3. You can pay off debt in under 2 years with current budget**
- If you can eliminate debt quickly, don't refinance
- Closing costs ($10,100 for me) aren't worth it for short-term debt
- My 6.2-year minimum payment timeline made refi worthwhile

**4. Your home equity is under 20%**
- Cash-out refi requires 20%+ equity (80% max LTV)
- Low equity means small cash-out amount or denied application
- I had 33% equity which was comfortable for consolidation

**5. You're planning to move in under 3 years**
- Closing costs ($10,100) need time to recover through savings
- My breakeven: $10,100 ÷ $712/month savings = 14.2 months
- Moving soon means you won't recover closing costs

## The Bottom Line: Higher Mortgage, Lower Stress

My debt consolidation cash-out refi increased my mortgage payment from $1,345 to $2,180—a $835/month jump. That sounds scary.

But it eliminated $1,547/month in debt payments (including extra payments I was making), resulting in **$712/month net savings** in my total monthly obligations.

**Total interest comparison (8.4-year timeline at $2,180/month budget):**
- Keep debt, pay $835/month: $158,200 total interest
- Cash-out refi at 6.75%: $177,000 total interest
- **Cash-out refi costs $18,800 more in interest**

Despite costing $18,800 more in total interest, the cash-out refi was worth it for:
- Fixed predictable payment (no rate increase risk)
- 49-point credit score improvement (689 → 738)
- Simplified single payment replacing 5 separate debts
- Tax-deductible mortgage interest vs non-deductible credit card interest
- Mental peace and reduced financial stress
- Ability to build emergency fund and increase retirement savings

The math shows slightly higher interest cost, but the real-life financial flexibility, credit improvement, and stress reduction were worth every penny.

If your debt interest rates are 12%+ and your total monthly obligations decrease despite higher mortgage payment, cash-out refi debt consolidation is likely worth serious consideration—even if it costs slightly more in total interest over the long run.
