I have $48,000 in high-interest credit card debt at an average 21% APR costing me $10,080/year in interest. My home has $145,000 in equity. Cash-out refinance seems like the perfect debt consolidation solution, right?

**Wrong.** At least for my situation.

I have a 3.5% mortgage rate on $265,000 borrowed in 2020. Replacing that with a 6.75% cash-out refi to consolidate debt would cost me $67,000 more in total interest over the life of the loan compared to using a HELOC at 9.5%.

Yes, you read that correctly: **A HELOC at 9.5% was cheaper than cash-out refi at 6.75%** for my debt consolidation.

Here's the complete math, when to preserve a low mortgage rate instead of doing cash-out refi, and the alternative I chose that saved tens of thousands of dollars.

## My Debt and Home Situation

**Debt to consolidate:**
- Credit card 1: $18,500 at 22.99% → $416/month minimum
- Credit card 2: $15,200 at 21.49% → $342/month minimum  
- Credit card 3: $9,800 at 18.99% → $220/month minimum
- Personal loan: $4,500 at 12.5% → $128/month minimum
- **Total debt: $48,000**
- **Monthly payments: $1,106**
- **Annual interest: $10,080**

This debt was killing my budget. I was making progress on principal, but slowly—most of my payments went to interest. At current payment rates, I'd be debt-free in 5-6 years but would pay an additional $18,000 in interest.

**Home equity position:**
- Home value: $410,000 (recent appraisal)
- Current mortgage: $265,000 at 3.5% (locked in 2020)
- Current payment: $1,190/month (P&I only)
- Remaining term: 26 years
- Equity: $145,000 (35%)

I had plenty of equity for debt consolidation. The question was: cash-out refi or HELOC?

## Cash-Out Refi Option: The Tempting but Expensive Choice

I got quotes from three lenders through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> for cash-out refinance:

**Best cash-out refi quote:**
- New loan amount: $313,000 (includes $48K debt payoff)
- Interest rate: 6.75%
- New monthly payment: $2,030 (P&I)
- Closing costs: $8,200
- Term: 30 years

**Monthly impact:**
- Old mortgage + debt payments: $1,190 + $1,106 = $2,296/month
- New mortgage payment: $2,030/month
- **Monthly savings: $266/month**

This looks attractive on the surface. My monthly payment drops by $266, and I eliminate all high-interest debt. The closing costs recover in 31 months ($8,200 ÷ $266 = 31).

But there's a massive hidden cost I almost missed.

## The Hidden Cost: Replacing 3.5% Rate with 6.75% Rate

Here's what my loan officer helped me understand: **Cash-out refi replaces your ENTIRE mortgage balance at the new, higher rate—not just the cash-out portion.**

**Interest cost comparison on the EXISTING $265,000 mortgage:**

**Current mortgage (3.5% for remaining 26 years):**
- Principal: $265,000
- Interest rate: 3.5%
- Monthly payment: $1,190
- Remaining interest (26 years): $106,280

**New cash-out refi mortgage ($265,000 portion at 6.75% for 30 years):**
- Principal: $265,000 (same balance)
- Interest rate: 6.75%
- Portion of new $2,030 payment: $1,720/month
- Total interest (30 years): $354,200

**Additional interest on existing mortgage balance: $354,200 - $106,280 = $247,920**

Wait—replacing my 3.5% rate with 6.75% costs me an extra $247,920 in interest over 30 years, just to consolidate $48,000 in debt?

Let me calculate the full picture including debt consolidation benefits:

**Total interest with cash-out refi (30 years):**
- Interest on full $313,000 loan: $417,800
- Less closing costs recovered through debt payoff: $8,200
- **Net total interest: $409,600**

**Total interest if I keep current mortgage + pay off debt separately:**
- Remaining interest on $265K mortgage at 3.5%: $106,280
- Interest on $48K debt at 21% avg if paid off in 5 years: $18,000 (estimated)
- **Total interest: $124,280**

**Cash-out refi costs me an extra $285,320 in interest over 30 years.**

Even accounting for monthly savings and improved cash flow, this was financial suicide for my situation. The low 3.5% mortgage rate was too valuable to give up.

## HELOC Option: Higher Rate, But Much Lower Total Cost

My loan officer suggested an alternative: **Keep the 3.5% mortgage and use a HELOC for debt consolidation.**

**HELOC quote:**
- Credit line: $50,000 (up to 80% LTV minus first mortgage)
- Interest rate: 9.50% variable
- Draw period: 10 years (interest-only payments allowed)
- Repayment period: 20 years after draw period
- Closing costs: $1,400

**HELOC interest calculation (if I borrow $48,000):**
- $48,000 at 9.5% = $4,560/year interest
- Monthly payment (interest-only during draw): $380/month
- Or principal + interest payment: $450/month to pay off in 10 years

Wait—9.5% is higher than 6.75% cash-out refi rate. How is HELOC cheaper?

**The key difference: HELOC only applies high rate to the $48K debt portion. Cash-out refi applies higher rate to the ENTIRE $313K loan balance.**

## Side-by-Side Total Interest Comparison (10-Year Payoff Timeline)

Let me compare three scenarios over 10 years assuming I pay off the debt within that period:

**Scenario A: Keep current debt, pay off aggressively in 5 years**
- Mortgage interest (10 years at 3.5%): $82,700
- Debt interest (5 years at 21% avg): $18,000
- **Total interest: $100,700**

**Scenario B: Cash-out refi at 6.75%**
- Mortgage interest (10 years on $313K at 6.75%): $198,500
- **Total interest: $198,500**

**Scenario C: HELOC at 9.5%, pay off in 7 years**
- Mortgage interest (10 years at 3.5%): $82,700
- HELOC interest (7 years at 9.5%): $17,920
- **Total interest: $100,620**

**HELOC saves me $97,880 compared to cash-out refi over 10 years**, despite the 9.5% rate being 2.75% higher than the cash-out refi rate.

The math is counterintuitive but clear: **Preserving the low first mortgage rate and using HELOC only for debt consolidation results in dramatically lower total interest.**

## My Monthly Payment Comparison

**Current situation:**
- Mortgage: $1,190/month
- Debt payments: $1,106/month
- **Total: $2,296/month**

**With cash-out refi:**
- New mortgage: $2,030/month
- **Total: $2,030/month**
- **Savings: $266/month**

**With HELOC (paying off in 7 years):**
- Mortgage: $1,190/month (unchanged)
- HELOC payment: $710/month (P+I to pay off $48K in 7 years)
- **Total: $1,900/month**
- **Savings: $396/month**

Not only does HELOC save me $97,880 in total interest over 10 years, but it also **provides $130/month MORE cash flow** than cash-out refi.

This was a complete reversal of my initial assumption. I thought cash-out refi was always the better debt consolidation option due to lower rates. Wrong.

## When to Keep Your Low Mortgage Rate (Avoid Cash-Out Refi)

Based on my experience and analysis, **avoid cash-out refi for debt consolidation if:**

**1. Your existing mortgage rate is 4.5% or lower**
- Current cash-out refi rates (6.5-7.5%) are 2-3% higher
- The rate increase on your full mortgage balance outweighs debt consolidation savings
- Calculate: (New rate - Old rate) × Existing mortgage balance × Remaining years

**2. You have significant remaining mortgage term (20+ years)**
- More years = more interest paid at the higher rate
- Short remaining term (5-10 years) reduces the penalty of rate increase
- My 26 years remaining made rate increase extremely expensive

**3. HELOC rate is within 3% of cash-out refi rate**
- Example: Cash-out refi at 6.75%, HELOC at 9.5% = 2.75% difference
- The HELOC rate premium is small enough to justify preserving low mortgage rate
- If HELOC were 12%+, cash-out refi might make more sense

**4. Your debt amount is less than 25% of mortgage balance**
- My $48K debt was 18% of my $265K mortgage balance
- Smaller debt proportion = less benefit from cash-out refi
- Larger debt amounts (50%+ of mortgage) shift the math toward cash-out refi

**5. You can pay off HELOC in 7-10 years**
- Aggressive HELOC payoff limits total interest despite higher rate
- If you'll only make minimum payments, cash-out refi might be better
- I committed to $710/month HELOC payment for 7-year payoff

## When Cash-Out Refi DOES Make Sense for Debt Consolidation

Cash-out refi is the better choice when:

**1. Your existing mortgage rate is 5.5% or higher**
- Smaller rate differential between old and new mortgage
- Example: 5.75% old rate, 6.75% new rate = only 1% increase
- The debt consolidation benefit outweighs minimal rate increase

**2. HELOC rates significantly exceed cash-out refi rates (4%+ difference)**
- If HELOC is 11-12% and cash-out refi is 6.75%, the HELOC premium is too high
- Dramatically higher HELOC rates make cash-out refi more attractive

**3. Your remaining mortgage term is short (under 10 years)**
- Less time for higher rate to accumulate extra interest
- Example: 8 years remaining means only 8 years of 6.75% vs 3.5%
- Short timeline reduces penalty of rate increase

**4. Debt amount is large (40%+ of mortgage balance)**
- Larger debt consolidation creates bigger interest savings
- Interest savings on debt can offset mortgage rate increase
- My 18% ratio was too small; 50%+ ratio shifts the calculation

**5. You can't qualify for HELOC (credit/DTI issues)**
- HELOC typically requires 680+ credit and lower DTI than cash-out refi
- If HELOC isn't available, cash-out refi might be the only equity-access option

## My Final Decision and Results

I chose the HELOC debt consolidation strategy:

**What I did:**
- Opened $50,000 HELOC at 9.5% variable rate
- Used $48,000 to pay off all credit cards and personal loan
- Kept $2,000 available for emergencies
- Committed to $710/month HELOC payment (7-year payoff)
- Preserved my 3.5% mortgage rate on $265,000 balance

**12 months later:**
- HELOC balance: $41,200 (paid down $6,800 in first year)
- Monthly payment: $1,900 total ($1,190 mortgage + $710 HELOC)
- Monthly savings vs old situation: $396/month
- Credit score: 682 → 728 (utilization dropped from 84% to 2%)
- Total interest paid: $4,180 on HELOC + $9,275 on mortgage = $13,455

**If I'd chosen cash-out refi:**
- Mortgage balance: $310,600 (after 12 months payments)
- Total interest paid: $20,850 in first year
- **Extra interest cost: $7,395 in first year alone**

The HELOC strategy is working exactly as planned. I'm saving $396/month in cash flow, paying down debt aggressively, and most importantly, **preserving my valuable 3.5% mortgage rate** for the remaining $265,000 balance.

Over the full 7-year HELOC payoff period, I'll save approximately **$97,880 in total interest** compared to cash-out refi, while also improving monthly cash flow by $130.

## Key Considerations for HELOC Debt Consolidation

If you're considering HELOC instead of cash-out refi:

**HELOC advantages:**
- Preserves low first mortgage rate
- Lower closing costs ($500-$2,000 vs $7K-$10K)
- Faster access to funds (2-3 weeks vs 30-45 days)
- Only pay interest on amount borrowed
- Can pay off and close HELOC once debt is eliminated

**HELOC drawbacks:**
- Variable rate (can increase if Fed raises rates further)
- Higher rate than cash-out refi in most cases
- Requires discipline to pay off aggressively
- Risk of re-accumulating credit card debt

**HELOC success requires:**
- Commitment to aggressive payoff (7-10 years max)
- Not using paid-off credit cards to rack up new debt
- Building emergency fund while paying down HELOC
- Understanding your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> affects HELOC approval

## The Bottom Line: When to Preserve Your Low Rate

If your mortgage rate is below 4.5%, **do the math before doing cash-out refi** for debt consolidation:

1. **Calculate total interest** on your existing mortgage for remaining term at current rate
2. **Calculate total interest** on new cash-out refi loan at higher rate
3. **Compare the difference** to the interest savings from debt consolidation
4. **Consider HELOC** as an alternative that preserves your low first mortgage rate

For me, keeping my 3.5% mortgage and using a 9.5% HELOC for debt consolidation saved $97,880 over 10 years compared to cash-out refi at 6.75%. The higher HELOC rate only applied to $48,000, while cash-out refi would have replaced my entire $265,000 balance at 3.25% higher rate.

This was counterintuitive—I initially assumed cash-out refi was always better due to lower rates. But when you have a low mortgage rate locked in (especially from 2020-2021), preserving that rate and using HELOC for debt consolidation is often the smartest financial decision.
