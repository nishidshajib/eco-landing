Cash-out refinance for debt consolidation sounds appealing: replace 18-22% credit card debt with 6-7% mortgage rates and save thousands in interest. But there's a critical question most homeowners skip: **How long does it take to recover closing costs through monthly savings?**

I learned this lesson when I almost made a $9,200 mistake by doing cash-out refi without understanding breakeven timelines.

Here's the complete breakeven math for debt consolidation through cash-out refinancing, including real scenarios and when it makes financial sense versus keeping high-interest debt or choosing alternatives.

## Understanding Cash-Out Refi Closing Costs

Cash-out refinance closing costs typically range from $7,000 to $12,000 depending on loan amount, location, and lender. Here's what you're actually paying:

**Typical closing cost breakdown (for $300K cash-out refi):**
- Origination fee: $2,100-$3,000 (0.7-1% of loan)
- Appraisal: $500-$700
- Title insurance: $1,500-$2,500
- Title search and exam: $300-$500
- Survey: $400-$600
- Attorney fees: $800-$1,200
- Recording fees: $100-$300
- Credit report: $50-$100
- Flood certification: $20-$50
- Tax service fee: $75-$100
- Prepaid interest: $500-$1,000 (varies by closing date)
- Escrow setup: $1,000-$2,000 (property taxes + insurance)

**Total estimated closing costs: $7,345-$11,050**

For my $285,000 cash-out refi, closing costs were $8,400. That's $8,400 I had to recover through debt consolidation interest savings before the refinance became profitable.

## The Breakeven Formula for Debt Consolidation

The basic formula for cash-out refi debt consolidation breakeven:

**Breakeven months = Total closing costs ÷ Monthly savings from debt consolidation**

But calculating "monthly savings" requires understanding both interest savings AND monthly payment changes.

**Step 1: Calculate current debt costs**
- Total monthly debt payments = Sum of all debt minimum payments
- Annual interest = Sum of (each debt balance × interest rate)

**Step 2: Calculate new mortgage costs**
- Portion of new mortgage attributable to debt consolidation = Cash-out amount used for debt payoff
- Annual interest on debt portion = Debt payoff amount × cash-out refi rate
- Monthly payment increase = Change in mortgage payment after refi

**Step 3: Calculate monthly net savings**
Monthly savings = (Old debt payments) - (Mortgage payment increase)

**Step 4: Calculate breakeven timeline**
Breakeven months = Closing costs ÷ Monthly savings

Let me show you three real scenarios with different breakeven timelines.

## Scenario 1: Fast Breakeven (12 Months) - High-Interest Debt

**Debt profile:**
- Credit card 1: $22,000 at 22.99% → $495/month minimum
- Credit card 2: $18,000 at 20.49% → $405/month minimum
- Auto loan: $15,000 at 8.9% → $310/month minimum
- **Total debt: $55,000**
- **Monthly payments: $1,210**
- **Annual interest: $9,680**

**Home situation:**
- Home value: $420,000
- Current mortgage: $290,000 at 5.75%
- Current payment: $1,693/month
- Equity: $130,000 (31%)

**Cash-out refi at 80% LTV:**
- New loan: $336,000
- Cash out: $46,000 (after closing costs)
- Rate: 6.875%
- New payment: $2,212/month
- Closing costs: $8,600

**Wait—cash-out only provides $46K, but debt is $55K. Options:**
1. Pay off highest-interest debt only with $46K
2. Use $9K from savings to pay off all debt

I chose option 1: pay off credit cards ($40K) and use remaining $6K toward auto loan.

**Debt after cash-out refi:**
- Credit cards: $0
- Auto loan: $9,000 at 8.9% → $185/month

**Monthly savings calculation:**
- Old payments: $1,210/month
- New mortgage increase: $2,212 - $1,693 = $519/month
- Remaining auto payment: $185/month
- **Net monthly savings: $1,210 - $519 - $185 = $506/month**

**Breakeven timeline: $8,600 ÷ $506 = 17 months**

But that's only looking at monthly cash flow. The interest savings tell a more complete story:

**Interest comparison:**
- Old debt annual interest: $9,680
- New mortgage interest on $46K at 6.875%: $3,163
- Remaining auto loan interest: $800/year
- **Annual interest savings: $9,680 - $3,163 - $800 = $5,717/year**

**True breakeven (interest savings): $8,600 ÷ $5,717 per year = 18 months**

This is a clear winner. Breaking even in 18 months means any period longer than that generates pure savings. Over 5 years, I'd save $28,585 - $8,600 = **$19,985 net benefit**.

## Scenario 2: Moderate Breakeven (24 Months) - Mixed Debt

**Debt profile:**
- Credit cards: $28,000 at 18.5% avg → $630/month
- Personal loan: $12,000 at 11.9% → $270/month
- Auto loan: $18,000 at 6.9% → $355/month
- **Total debt: $58,000**
- **Monthly payments: $1,255**
- **Annual interest: $7,780**

**Cash-out refi (similar home situation):**
- Cash out: $58,000
- Rate: 6.75%
- Mortgage payment increase: $385/month
- Closing costs: $9,100

**Monthly savings calculation:**
- Old payments: $1,255/month
- Mortgage increase: $385/month
- **Net savings: $870/month**

**Breakeven: $9,100 ÷ $870 = 10.5 months**

Wait—that seems fast. Let's check the interest savings:

**Interest comparison:**
- Old debt annual interest: $7,780
- New mortgage interest on $58K at 6.75%: $3,915
- **Annual interest savings: $3,865**

**True breakeven: $9,100 ÷ $3,865 = 28 months**

There's a discrepancy between cash flow breakeven (10.5 months) and interest savings breakeven (28 months). This happens because you're extending debt payoff from 3-5 years to 30 years through the mortgage.

The cash flow improves immediately, but true interest savings take longer to materialize. If you're staying in the home 3+ years, this still makes sense.

## Scenario 3: Long Breakeven (36+ Months) - Lower-Interest Debt

**Debt profile:**
- Credit cards: $15,000 at 16.9% → $338/month
- Auto loan: $24,000 at 5.9% → $465/month
- Student loan: $18,000 at 6.5% → $200/month
- **Total debt: $57,000**
- **Monthly payments: $1,003**
- **Annual interest: $4,445**

**Cash-out refi:**
- Cash out: $57,000
- Rate: 6.875%
- Mortgage payment increase: $377/month
- Closing costs: $9,400

**Monthly savings:**
- Old payments: $1,003/month
- Mortgage increase: $377/month
- **Net savings: $626/month**

**Breakeven: $9,400 ÷ $626 = 15 months**

But check the interest savings:

**Interest comparison:**
- Old debt annual interest: $4,445
- New mortgage interest on $57K at 6.875%: $3,919
- **Annual interest savings: $526**

**True interest breakeven: $9,400 ÷ $526 = 18 years!**

This is a **BAD debt consolidation candidate**. While monthly cash flow improves by $626, you're barely saving any interest—in fact, over 30 years, you'll pay MORE total interest by consolidating lower-rate debt into a mortgage.

**Alternative: Don't consolidate low-interest debt.** Only use cash-out refi for the $15K credit card at 16.9%. Leave the 5.9% auto loan and 6.5% student loan alone.

## When Cash-Out Refi Debt Consolidation Makes Sense

Based on breakeven analysis, cash-out refi makes financial sense when:

**1. Breakeven is under 24 months**
- You recover closing costs within 2 years
- High-interest debt (18%+) consolidation typically hits this threshold
- Calculate: closing costs ÷ monthly savings < 24

**2. You're staying in the home 3+ years**
- Even 24-30 month breakeven works if you're staying 5+ years
- Selling before breakeven means you lose money on the transaction
- Moving timeline matters more than the breakeven itself

**3. Interest rate differential exceeds 10%**
- Credit cards at 20% consolidating to mortgage at 6.5% = 13.5% differential
- This creates meaningful interest savings beyond cash flow improvement
- Auto loans at 6% consolidating to mortgage at 6.5% = negative differential (don't consolidate)

**4. Monthly cash flow improvement exceeds $500**
- Meaningful budget relief for financial stability
- Helps rebuild emergency funds faster
- Creates breathing room for other financial goals

**5. You plan to aggressively pay down the debt portion of the mortgage**
- Commit to paying extra $300-500/month toward principal
- This prevents extending short-term debt into 30-year obligation
- Combine cash flow savings with accelerated payoff for maximum benefit

## When to Skip Cash-Out Refi and Keep High-Interest Debt

Counterintuitively, sometimes it's better to **NOT** consolidate debt through cash-out refinancing:

**Skip cash-out refi if:**

1. **Breakeven exceeds 36 months** - Too long to recover closing costs; use debt avalanche method instead

2. **You're selling the home within 3 years** - Won't recover closing costs before selling

3. **Your existing mortgage rate is significantly lower than cash-out rates** - Example: 3.5% current mortgage, 6.75% cash-out refi means you're increasing rate on the entire loan balance to consolidate debt

4. **You can pay off debt in 12-18 months without refi** - Closing costs become wasted money if you can eliminate debt quickly through aggressive payments

5. **Debt amount is small relative to closing costs** - Consolidating $15K debt with $8K closing costs = 53% closing cost ratio (too high)

## Alternative: HELOC for Debt Consolidation

If your existing mortgage rate is low (3-4%), consider HELOC instead of cash-out refi:

**HELOC debt consolidation benefits:**
- Preserves low first mortgage rate
- Lower closing costs ($500-$1,500 vs $7K-$10K for cash-out refi)
- Faster breakeven (2-6 months typical)
- Can pay off and close HELOC once debt is eliminated

**HELOC drawbacks:**
- Variable rate (typically 8-10% currently)
- Higher rate than cash-out refi in most cases
- Payment can increase if rates rise further

**HELOC breakeven example:**
- $50K debt consolidation
- HELOC rate: 9.5%
- HELOC closing costs: $1,200
- Monthly savings: $650 (similar to cash-out refi scenario)
- **Breakeven: $1,200 ÷ $650 = 1.8 months**

HELOC makes sense when your first mortgage rate is below 4.5% and you want to preserve that low rate.

## My Cash-Out Refi Debt Consolidation Decision

After running the breakeven math, here's what I chose:

**My scenario:**
- $42K high-interest credit card debt (20% avg rate)
- $8,400 closing costs
- $685/month net savings after mortgage increase
- **Breakeven: 12.3 months**
- Annual interest savings: $6,420
- Staying in home: 7+ years planned

**Result:** Cash-out refi made sense. I recovered closing costs in 12 months and saved $38,520 in interest over 6 years of debt consolidation.

But I also made a critical decision: **pay extra $400/month toward mortgage principal** to pay off the debt portion in 7 years instead of 30 years. This prevented long-term interest accumulation while benefiting from immediate cash flow improvement.

## Key Takeaways for Breakeven Analysis

Before doing <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">cash-out refinance for debt consolidation</a>, calculate your specific breakeven timeline:

1. **Get exact closing cost estimates** from 3-4 lenders—costs vary significantly
2. **Calculate true monthly savings** including mortgage payment increase, not just eliminated debt payments
3. **Verify your breakeven is under 24 months** for optimal debt consolidation benefit
4. **Consider your timeline**—staying 3+ years makes longer breakeven acceptable
5. **Only consolidate high-interest debt** (15%+ rates)—leave low-interest debt alone
6. **Plan for accelerated payoff** to avoid extending short-term debt to 30 years

Understanding your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> also affects closing costs and rates, which directly impact breakeven timelines.

For my situation, the 12-month breakeven made cash-out refi debt consolidation an obvious choice. But if your breakeven exceeds 30 months, consider alternatives like HELOC, debt avalanche payoff method, or partial consolidation of only the highest-interest debt.
