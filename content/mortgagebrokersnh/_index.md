New Hampshire mortgage brokers access **wholesale lender networks** that retail banks cannot offer. Instead of one bank's pricing and underwriting rules, brokers submit your application to 20+ lenders—finding best rates, terms, and approval odds across conventional, FHA, VA, jumbo, and portfolio options.

**Wholesale pricing runs 0.125%–0.375% below retail** on identical loans. Wholesale lenders (United Wholesale Mortgage, Caliber, Flagstar) compete for broker volume by offering tighter margins than retail branches. Even after broker compensation (1%–2%), total APR often beats retail bank pricing.

**Multi-lender shopping solves approval challenges.** If Lender A declines or prices high, brokers move to Lender B or C without restarting your process. This matters for self-employed borrowers, investors, cash-out refinances over 80% LTV, or credit scores 620–680 where automated retail underwriting often declines.
