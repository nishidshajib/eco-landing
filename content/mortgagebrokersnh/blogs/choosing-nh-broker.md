Choosing a New Hampshire mortgage broker requires evaluating **lender access, fee transparency, experience, and licensing**—not just accepting the first broker referral from your realtor.

## What Makes a Good NH Mortgage Broker

Quality brokers provide:

1. **Wide lender access** (15+ wholesale lenders across conventional, FHA, VA, jumbo, non-QM)
2. **Transparent fee disclosure** (clear origination charges in Loan Estimate)
3. **Relevant experience** (knows NH market nuances: seasonal homes, septic systems, investment properties)
4. **NMLS licensing** (active NH license, no regulatory actions)
5. **Responsive communication** (returns calls within 24 hours, explains options clearly)

## Questions to Ask NH Mortgage Brokers

Before committing to a broker, ask:

### 1. "How many wholesale lenders do you work with?"

**Good answer:** 15–25 lenders across conventional (UWM, Caliber, Flagstar), government (PennyMac, Rocket Pro), jumbo (LoanDepot, Angel Oak), and non-QM (Deephaven, Acra).

**Red flag:** "I work with 3–5 lenders." Limited access = limited pricing competition.

### 2. "What's your broker fee structure?"

**Good answer:** "1%–2% origination fee, disclosed in your Loan Estimate. Or we can do lender-paid compensation at a slightly higher rate if you prefer."

**Red flag:** Vague answers like "we make it work" or refusing to disclose fee percentage upfront.

### 3. "Can you provide references from recent NH clients?"

**Good answer:** Offers 2–3 recent client contacts (with permission) who closed similar loan types in past 6 months.

**Red flag:** "We don't give out client info" or only provides reviews from 2+ years ago.

### 4. "Are you licensed in New Hampshire?"

**Good answer:** Provides NMLS number and confirms active NH license. You can verify at nmlsconsumeraccess.org.

**Red flag:** Unlicensed "loan officer" working under broker's license without own NMLS number.

### 5. "What happens if your first lender choice declines my loan?"

**Good answer:** "I submit to multiple lenders simultaneously or move quickly to backup lender. You won't need to restart your application."

**Red flag:** "That rarely happens" (it happens often—quality brokers have backup plans).

### 6. "Do you specialize in any loan types?"

**Good answer:** "We handle all loan types but have strong relationships with portfolio lenders for self-employed borrowers" (shows expertise).

**Red flag:** "We do everything for everyone" (generalists often lack depth in complex scenarios).

### 7. "What's your typical closing timeline?"

**Good answer:** "25–35 days for purchases, 20–30 days for refinances, depending on appraisal and underwriting."

**Red flag:** "We close in 10 days every time" (overpromising) or "it takes as long as it takes" (no accountability).

## Evaluating Broker Lender Access

Strong NH brokers maintain relationships with:

**Conventional/FHA Wholesale:**
- United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM)
- Caliber Home Loans
- Flagstar Bank
- PennyMac
- Rocket Pro TPO

**Jumbo/Portfolio:**
- LoanDepot
- Plaza Home Mortgage
- Angel Oak
- Deephaven
- CrossCountry Mortgage

**Non-QM/Specialty:**
- Acra Lending
- Sprout Mortgage
- CMG Financial
- Quontic Bank

Ask broker: **"Which of these lenders are you approved with?"** More approvals = more pricing and underwriting options.

## Understanding Broker Fee Structures

NH brokers charge fees three ways:

### 1. Percentage-Based Origination (Most Common)
- **1%–2% of loan amount**
- $400k loan = $4k–$8k broker fee
- Disclosed in Loan Estimate Section A
- You pay at closing

### 2. Flat-Fee Origination (Rare)
- **Fixed $3k–$5k** regardless of loan amount
- Better for large loans (>$600k)
- Worse for small loans (<$250k)

### 3. Lender-Paid Compensation (Yield Spread Premium)
- **0% borrower fee**
- Broker takes higher rate (0.25%–0.50% above par)
- Lender pays broker from rate premium
- Must be disclosed

**Best practice:** Get quotes showing both borrower-paid (lower rate, higher fee) and lender-paid (higher rate, zero fee) options. Compare APR to decide.

## Red Flags in NH Mortgage Brokers

Avoid brokers who:

### 1. Won't Provide NMLS License Number
All NH mortgage brokers must hold active NMLS licenses. Unlicensed brokers cannot legally broker loans in New Hampshire.

### 2. Pressure Quick Decisions
Quality brokers let you shop and compare. High-pressure tactics ("this rate expires today") are red flags.

### 3. Promise Unrealistic Rates
If broker quotes 5.75% when market rates are 6.25%–6.50%, it's bait-and-switch. Verify rates match current wholesale pricing.

### 4. Have Regulatory Actions on NMLS Record
Check nmlsconsumeraccess.org for regulatory actions, license suspensions, or consumer complaints.

### 5. Refuse to Provide Loan Estimate Within 3 Days
Federal law requires Loan Estimate within 3 business days of application. Delayed disclosures = hidden fees.

### 6. Can't Explain APR Differences
Good brokers explain why their APR is higher/lower than competitors. Evasive answers = lack of transparency.

## Verifying NH Broker Licensing

Visit **nmlsconsumeraccess.org** and search broker's name or NMLS number:

**Check for:**
- Active New Hampshire mortgage broker license
- Years in business (5+ years preferred)
- No regulatory actions or suspensions
- Associated company's NMLS record

**Red flags:**
- License expired or inactive
- Multiple state regulatory actions
- Recent license (< 1 year experience)
- No company affiliation listed

## Experience in NH-Specific Scenarios

New Hampshire has unique lending considerations:

### Seasonal Homes (Lakes Region, White Mountains)
Ask: "How do you handle winter access restrictions for appraisals and inspections?"

**Good answer:** Knows which lenders allow exterior-only appraisals or delayed water/septic testing until spring.

### Septic Systems
NH homes often have septic vs sewer. Ask: "Do your lenders require septic inspections?"

**Good answer:** Knows which lenders waive septic inspections for refinances or accept seller certifications vs requiring full pumping/inspection.

### Second Homes vs Investment Properties
Lakes Region has many second homes. Ask: "How do lenders classify seasonal rental properties?"

**Good answer:** Understands difference between second home (better rates, no rental income required) vs investment property (rental income required, higher rates).

### Regional Lender Preferences
Ask: "Do you work with NH portfolio lenders like Service Credit Union or St. Mary's Bank?"

**Good answer:** Maintains relationships with local portfolio lenders for edge cases retail/wholesale can't solve.

## Broker Communication Standards

Quality NH brokers provide:

**Initial response:** Within 24 hours of inquiry
**Rate quotes:** Within 24–48 hours of scenario details
**Loan Estimate:** Within 3 business days of application
**Status updates:** Weekly during processing, daily during underwriting
**Pre-closing contact:** 2–3 days before closing to review numbers

Set communication expectations upfront: "How often will you update me during processing?"

## Comparing Multiple NH Brokers

Get quotes from **3 brokers** to compare:

1. **Local independent broker** (knows NH market, may have fewer lender approvals)
2. **Regional broker network** (more lender access, may be less personal)
3. **Online broker platform** (Better, Rocket Pro) for national benchmark

Compare these metrics:

- **APR** (rate + all fees)
- **Lender variety** (number of wholesale approvals)
- **Experience** (years in NH lending, loan types closed)
- **Licensing** (NMLS record, regulatory actions)
- **Communication** (responsiveness, clarity)

Don't choose based solely on lowest rate—consider total package.

## Broker Recommendations: Who to Trust

**Good referral sources:**
- **Past clients** (ask friends/colleagues who recently financed in NH)
- **Real estate attorneys** (see which brokers close cleanly)
- **Financial advisors** (know which brokers serve their clients well)

**Questionable referral sources:**
- **Realtors** (often have affiliate agreements with specific brokers)
- **Builder referrals** (may have kickback arrangements)
- **Facebook ads** (easy to advertise, hard to verify quality)

Realtor and builder referrals **can be good**—but verify independently via NMLS and client references.

## Broker Portfolios: Conventional vs Non-QM Specialists

Some NH brokers specialize:

**Conventional/FHA Specialists:**
- High volume, efficient processing
- Best for standard W-2 borrowers
- May lack non-QM lender relationships

**Non-QM/Portfolio Specialists:**
- Expert at self-employed, investor, credit-challenge scenarios
- Access to 8–10 portfolio lenders
- May have higher fees (2%–3%) due to complexity

**Full-Service Brokers:**
- Handle all loan types
- 15–25 lender relationships
- Best for most NH borrowers

Ask: **"What percentage of your loans are conventional vs non-QM?"** to understand broker's focus.

## Technology and Process Efficiency

Quality brokers offer:

- **Online application portals** (upload docs securely)
- **E-signature** (DocuSign for disclosures and closing)
- **Automated status updates** (email/text when file moves to underwriting)
- **Mobile communication** (text updates for time-sensitive issues)

Old-school brokers requiring in-person meetings and paper applications slow down the process.

## Final Broker Selection Criteria

Choose an NH mortgage broker who:

1. **Has 15+ wholesale lender approvals** (UWM, Caliber, Flagstar, etc.)
2. **Charges transparent 1%–2% origination** (disclosed upfront)
3. **Holds active NMLS license** with clean regulatory record
4. **Provides 2–3 recent client references**
5. **Responds within 24 hours** to initial inquiry
6. **Explains APR differences clearly** vs competitor quotes
7. **Knows NH lending nuances** (seasonal homes, septic, regional markets)

Get quotes from 3 brokers, compare APR and lender access, verify NMLS licensing, and choose based on **total value (pricing + service + expertise)** rather than lowest rate alone.

## Trust Your Instincts

If a broker feels pushy, evasive about fees, or makes unrealistic promises, **walk away**. New Hampshire has 100+ licensed mortgage brokers—you have options.

The right broker should feel like a trusted advisor who explains options, compares lenders transparently, and has your best financial outcome as the primary goal—not just closing any loan to earn a commission.
