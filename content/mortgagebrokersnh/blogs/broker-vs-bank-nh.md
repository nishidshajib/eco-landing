New Hampshire borrowers choosing between **mortgage brokers and retail banks** face a fundamental trade-off: multi-lender access and wholesale pricing versus single-lender convenience and brand familiarity.

## How Mortgage Brokers Work

Brokers are **intermediaries** between borrowers and wholesale lenders:

1. **You apply once** with the broker
2. **Broker shops 5–20 lenders** for best rate/terms
3. **Broker recommends lender** based on pricing and approval odds
4. **Wholesale lender underwrites and funds** the loan
5. **Broker earns origination fee** (1%–2%) or yield spread premium

Brokers don't lend their own money—they access wholesale lending networks unavailable to consumers directly.

## How Retail Banks Work

Banks are **direct lenders** using their own capital:

1. **You apply with the bank**
2. **Bank underwrites in-house** using automated or manual systems
3. **Bank prices based on internal costs** plus profit margin
4. **Bank funds the loan** from deposits or warehouse lines
5. **Bank may sell loan** to Fannie/Freddie after closing

You get one lender's pricing, one set of underwriting overlays, and one approval decision.

## Wholesale vs Retail Pricing: The 0.25% Difference

Wholesale lenders price **0.125%–0.375% below retail** to compete for broker volume:

**Example Portsmouth $450k conventional loan:**

**Retail Bank:**
- Rate: 6.500%
- Bank profit margin: built into rate
- Origination fee: $1,500
- APR: 6.621%

**Mortgage Broker:**
- Rate: 6.250% (wholesale pricing)
- Broker fee: 1.5% = $6,750
- APR: 6.548%

Despite visible broker fee, **APR is 0.073% lower** due to wholesale rate advantage. On $450k, this saves $275/year in interest.

## When Brokers Save Money

Brokers typically beat retail banks on:

### 1. FHA/VA Loans
Wholesale FHA/VA pricing runs 0.125%–0.25% below retail banks because wholesale aggregators (United Wholesale Mortgage, Caliber) specialize in government loan volume.

### 2. Jumbo Loans
Brokers access 10+ jumbo lenders (private portfolio banks) vs 1–2 at retail banks. Competition drives better pricing on NH jumbo loans >$806,500.

### 3. Non-QM/Portfolio Loans
Self-employed, investor, or credit-challenged borrowers need portfolio underwriting. Brokers access 5–8 specialty lenders vs most banks having zero portfolio options.

### 4. Investment Properties
Retail banks often cap investors at 4 properties. Brokers access lenders approving 5–10 financed properties with competitive pricing.

## When Banks Save Money

Retail banks sometimes beat brokers on:

### 1. High-Credit Conventional Loans
NH credit unions (Service CU, Granite State CU) offer competitive retail pricing for 740+ credit scores with standard W-2 income. May beat broker APR by 0.10%–0.15%.

### 2. Portfolio Relationship Discounts
If you have $100k+ deposits at TD Bank or Citizens, relationship pricing can beat broker wholesale rates by 0.125%–0.25%.

### 3. Small Loan Amounts
On loans <$200k, broker percentage fees ($2k–$4k) may exceed APR savings from wholesale pricing. Banks with flat $1,000–$1,500 fees can win.

### 4. Simple Scenarios
Standard purchase, strong credit, W-2 income, 20% down—retail banks price competitively and offer one-stop convenience.

## Approval Odds: Broker Multi-Lender Advantage

This is where brokers shine for **non-perfect scenarios**:

**Example: Self-Employed Manchester Buyer**

**Retail Bank Path:**
- Apply to TD Bank
- Automated underwriting declines (tax returns show $60k income but business expenses reduce AGI)
- Start over with Bank of America
- Same result
- Give up or pay 20%+ down to force manual underwriting

**Broker Path:**
- Apply once with broker
- Broker submits to portfolio lender using bank statement income (12 months deposits = $95k annual income)
- Approved at 10% down with competitive portfolio rate
- One application, one approval

Brokers increase approval odds by **matching your profile to the right lender's underwriting appetite**.

## Underwriting Overlay Differences

Retail banks often have **overlays** (rules stricter than Fannie/Freddie minimums):

**Common Bank Overlays:**
- Minimum 680 credit (Fannie allows 620)
- No recent bankruptcy within 4 years (Fannie allows 2–4 years)
- Maximum 4 financed properties (Fannie allows 10)
- No cash-out refinance over 70% LTV (Fannie allows 80%)

Brokers access **overlay-free wholesale lenders** that follow Fannie/Freddie minimums without extra restrictions.

## New Hampshire Regional Broker Access

Broker advantages vary by NH market:

**Portsmouth/Manchester:**
- 8–12 active brokers compete with 10+ retail banks
- Wholesale pricing advantage exists but banks stay competitive
- Broker value: portfolio access for non-QM scenarios

**Lakes Region/Northern NH:**
- Fewer retail banks (3–5 active)
- Brokers provide critical wholesale access to match Portsmouth pricing
- Seasonal/second home expertise matters—brokers know which lenders approve

## Fee Transparency: Broker vs Bank

**Broker fees are disclosed** in Loan Estimate Section A:
- Origination charge: 1%–2% of loan amount
- Or yield spread premium: if you take higher rate, lender pays broker (disclosed)

**Bank fees are less visible**:
- Retail margin built into rate (not separately disclosed)
- Processing, underwriting, application fees (vary by bank)
- Total APR shows true cost, but harder to see bank profit margin

## Service Differences

**Brokers:**
- One point of contact (broker) through closing
- Broker has incentive to close (earns fee at funding)
- Underwriting happens at wholesale lender (less broker control)
- May feel more personal/responsive

**Banks:**
- Loan officer, processor, underwriter all in-house
- Bank has less urgency (salaried employees vs commission broker)
- More control over timeline and conditions
- Brand familiarity, but may feel more corporate

## Processing Speed: Broker vs Bank

**Common perception:** Banks close faster because everything is in-house.

**Reality:** Brokers often close **as fast or faster**:
- Wholesale lenders (UWM, Caliber) have 7–10 day turn times
- Brokers pre-package files to reduce underwriting back-and-forth
- Retail banks sometimes have backlogs during high-volume periods

Typical NH closing timeline: **25–35 days** for both brokers and banks on conventional/FHA purchases.

## How to Choose: Broker vs Bank in New Hampshire

**Use a Broker if:**
- Self-employed, investor, or non-W-2 income
- Credit score 620–680 (need overlay-free lender)
- Cash-out refinance over 70%–80% LTV
- Buying 5th+ financed property
- Want multi-lender competition for best pricing
- Previous bank denial (broker can find alternative lender)

**Use a Retail Bank if:**
- Strong credit (740+), W-2 income, standard scenario
- Existing bank relationship with deposit discounts
- Small loan amount (<$200k) where broker % fees are high
- Prefer brand familiarity and one-stop banking

**Best Strategy: Get Both Quotes**

Smart NH borrowers get quotes from:
1. **Local mortgage broker** (wholesale multi-lender access)
2. **NH credit union** (Service CU, Granite State CU)
3. **National bank** (Rocket, Better) for benchmark

Compare APR, not just rate. Factor in broker fee vs retail margin. Choose based on **total cost and approval confidence**, not just brand name.

## NH Broker Licensing Verification

Verify your broker at **nmlsconsumeraccess.org**:
- NMLS license number
- Years in business
- Any regulatory actions
- License status in New Hampshire

Licensed NH brokers carry E&O insurance and follow state disclosure requirements.

## The Verdict for New Hampshire Borrowers

**Mortgage brokers typically win on:**
- Wholesale pricing (0.125%–0.375% rate advantage)
- Multi-lender access (better approval odds)
- Portfolio/non-QM loan options
- Jumbo and investment property financing

**Retail banks sometimes win on:**
- High-credit conventional loans at credit unions
- Relationship deposit discounts
- Small loan amounts (<$200k)
- Brand trust and one-stop convenience

For most New Hampshire borrowers—especially self-employed, investors, or those needing portfolio underwriting—**brokers provide better pricing and higher approval odds** despite visible origination fees. The wholesale rate advantage and lender competition usually outweigh the broker fee when comparing total APR.
