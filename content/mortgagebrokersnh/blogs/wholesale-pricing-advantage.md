New Hampshire mortgage brokers access **wholesale lending channels** that price 0.125%–0.375% below retail bank rates on identical loans—creating a structural rate advantage even after broker compensation.

## What is Wholesale Mortgage Lending?

**Wholesale lenders** fund loans but don't work directly with consumers:

- **United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM)**: Largest wholesale lender, broker-only channel
- **Caliber Home Loans**: Wholesale and retail, but wholesale pricing is tighter
- **Flagstar Bank**: Major wholesale aggregator for conventional/FHA
- **PennyMac**: Government loan specialist with wholesale broker channel
- **Angel Oak**: Non-QM and portfolio wholesale lender

These lenders **only accept applications through licensed mortgage brokers**—you cannot apply directly.

## Why Wholesale Pricing is Lower

Wholesale lenders price below retail because:

### 1. No Retail Branch Overhead
- No branch locations, no retail staff, no advertising to consumers
- Lower fixed costs = tighter margins possible
- Savings passed through as lower rates to brokers

### 2. Broker Volume Competition
- 50+ wholesale lenders compete for broker business
- Brokers send volume to lenders with best pricing
- Competition drives rates down 0.125%–0.375% vs retail

### 3. Efficient Processing Models
- Brokers pre-package loan files (reducing wholesale lender processing costs)
- Automated underwriting systems (UWM averages 7-day turn times)
- Scale efficiency: UWM funds $200B+ annually vs small retail banks at $2B–$5B

## Wholesale vs Retail Pricing: Real NH Examples

### Example 1: Portsmouth Conventional Purchase

**Scenario:** $500k purchase, 10% down, 740 credit, W-2 income

**Retail Bank (TD Bank):**
- Rate: 6.625%
- Origination fee: $1,500
- APR: 6.742%

**Broker (UWM Wholesale):**
- Rate: 6.375% (0.25% better)
- Broker fee: 1.5% = $7,500
- APR: 6.639% (0.103% lower)

**5-year savings:** Lower APR saves ~$450/year = $2,250 total despite higher upfront broker fee.

### Example 2: Manchester FHA Refinance

**Scenario:** $350k refi, 85% LTV, 680 credit

**Retail Bank (Citizens):**
- Rate: 6.250%
- Bank fees: $2,200
- APR: 6.412%

**Broker (Caliber Wholesale):**
- Rate: 5.990% (0.26% better)
- Broker fee: 1.75% = $6,125
- APR: 6.318% (0.094% lower)

**3-year savings:** Lower rate saves ~$750/year = $2,250—pays back higher broker fee difference in ~4 years.

### Example 3: Nashua Jumbo Loan

**Scenario:** $900k purchase, 20% down, 760 credit

**Retail Bank (Bank of America):**
- Rate: 6.750%
- Bank fees: $3,000
- APR: 6.823%

**Broker (Flagstar Wholesale):**
- Rate: 6.375% (0.375% better)
- Broker fee: 1% = $9,000
- APR: 6.521% (0.302% lower!)

**Annual savings:** 0.302% APR difference = $2,160/year on $720k loan amount—huge advantage.

## How Brokers Shop Wholesale Rates

NH brokers access **rate sheets** from 10–20 wholesale lenders daily:

1. **Broker logs into wholesale portals** (UWM, Caliber, Flagstar, etc.)
2. **Inputs your scenario**: loan amount, LTV, credit score, property type
3. **Compares wholesale rates** across all lenders
4. **Selects best pricing** for your profile
5. **Locks rate** with chosen wholesale lender

This takes 15–30 minutes—but generates pricing competition across 10+ lenders vs one retail bank quote.

## Wholesale Lender Specializations

Different wholesale lenders excel in different niches:

**United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM):**
- Best conventional wholesale pricing for 740+ credit
- Fast turn times (7–10 days to clear underwriting)
- High-volume scale creates tightest margins

**Caliber Home Loans:**
- Competitive FHA/VA wholesale pricing
- Good for 680–720 credit range
- Flexible portfolio options for edge cases

**Flagstar Bank:**
- Jumbo loan wholesale specialist
- Strong conventional high-balance pricing
- Good for NH markets needing $806k–$1.2M conforming jumbo

**PennyMac:**
- Government loan (FHA/VA) wholesale leader
- Best pricing for 620–680 credit scores on FHA
- Non-QM division for self-employed borrowers

**Angel Oak:**
- Non-QM and bank statement wholesale lender
- Self-employed, investor, credit-challenge scenarios
- Higher rates than conventional but best-in-class for portfolio

## Broker Compensation Models

Brokers earn money two ways on wholesale loans:

### 1. Borrower-Paid Origination (Most Common)
- You pay broker fee: 1%–2% of loan amount
- Broker gets wholesale par rate (no lender-paid compensation)
- Most transparent model

### 2. Lender-Paid Compensation (Yield Spread Premium)
- You pay 0% broker fee
- Broker takes slightly higher rate (0.25%–0.50% above par)
- Wholesale lender pays broker from rate premium
- Must be disclosed in Loan Estimate

**Example:**
- Par rate: 6.250% with 1.5% broker fee
- Lender-paid: 6.500% with 0% broker fee

Which is better depends on your time horizon—if refinancing in 2–3 years, 0% broker fee option may win despite higher rate.

## Do All Brokers Access Same Wholesale Pricing?

**No**—broker pricing varies based on:

### 1. Wholesale Lender Approvals
Not all brokers are approved with all wholesale lenders. Smaller NH brokers may have 5–10 lender relationships vs larger brokers with 20+ approvals.

### 2. Broker Volume Discounts
High-volume brokers ($50M+/year) get better wholesale pricing than low-volume brokers ($5M–$10M/year). Volume rebates can improve rates 0.0625%–0.125%.

### 3. Broker Fee Structure
Lower broker fees (1%) may come with slightly higher rates vs higher fees (2%) with lower rates. Compare **APR** to see true cost.

## Wholesale Pricing by Loan Type

Wholesale rate advantages vary:

**Conventional (740+ credit):** 0.125%–0.25% below retail
**FHA (680+ credit):** 0.125%–0.375% below retail (wholesale specialization)
**VA:** 0.125%–0.25% below retail
**Jumbo:** 0.25%–0.50% below retail (more lender variation)
**Non-QM/Portfolio:** 0.50%–1.00% below retail (retail banks often don't offer)

## New Hampshire Wholesale Lender Availability

All major wholesale lenders operate in NH:

- **UWM, Caliber, Flagstar:** Full conventional/FHA/VA programs
- **PennyMac, Rocket Pro (wholesale):** Government loan focus
- **Angel Oak, Deephaven, Acra:** Non-QM and portfolio
- **LoanDepot, HomePoint, Plaza:** Mid-tier wholesale aggregators

NH brokers have **equal wholesale access** to California or Texas brokers—location doesn't matter for wholesale pricing.

## Wholesale Processing Speed

**Myth:** Retail banks close faster because underwriting is in-house.

**Reality:** Wholesale lenders often **match or beat retail speed**:

- **UWM average turn time:** 7–10 days from submission to clear-to-close
- **Caliber/Flagstar:** 10–14 days
- **Retail banks:** 10–21 days (varies by volume/staffing)

NH brokers who pre-package files (get all docs upfront) help wholesale lenders process faster than retail bank borrowers who submit docs piecemeal.

## How to Verify Wholesale Pricing

Ask your NH broker:

1. **"Which wholesale lenders are you quoting?"**
2. **"Can I see the wholesale rate sheet for my scenario?"**
3. **"What's your broker fee—percentage or flat amount?"**
4. **"Is this borrower-paid or lender-paid compensation?"**
5. **"What's the total APR including your fee?"**

Compare wholesale broker APR to retail bank APR. Wholesale should be 0.10%–0.30% lower on most conventional/FHA/VA scenarios.

## When Retail Beats Wholesale

Retail banks can win on:

**Small loan amounts (<$200k):** Broker percentage fees are high relative to loan size. Retail banks with $1,000 flat fees may have lower APR.

**Credit union relationship discounts:** If you have $100k+ deposits, relationship pricing can beat wholesale by 0.125%–0.25%.

**Portfolio jumbo loans:** Some retail banks (Citizens, Eastern Bank) have competitive portfolio jumbo pricing vs wholesale.

## Wholesale Pricing Transparency

NH brokers must disclose:

- Wholesale par rate (the rate with 0% lender-paid compensation)
- Broker compensation (borrower-paid fee or lender-paid yield spread)
- Total APR including all fees

Request **Loan Estimate** within 3 days of application. Section A shows broker origination charge. Compare APR across broker and bank quotes.

## The Bottom Line on NH Wholesale Pricing

Wholesale mortgage channels provide **structural rate advantages** of 0.125%–0.375% below retail banks due to lower overhead, broker volume competition, and efficient processing.

Even after paying broker fees (1%–2%), wholesale APR typically beats retail bank APR by 0.10%–0.30%—saving hundreds per year on a typical NH mortgage.

For New Hampshire borrowers, getting at least one wholesale broker quote alongside retail bank quotes ensures you're seeing true market-competitive pricing rather than accepting one bank's retail margins.
