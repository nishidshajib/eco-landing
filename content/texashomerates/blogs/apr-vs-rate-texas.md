## APR vs. Rate in Texas: Why You're Probably Overpaying

Walk into any Texas mortgage lender and ask for their "best rate." You'll hear: **"5.875% conventional!"** Sounds great—until you see the Loan Estimate and realize the APR is 6.45%. What happened?

You just got hit with the oldest trick in the mortgage playbook: **rate vs. APR confusion**. Here's how to spot it, avoid it, and save thousands.

### What's the Difference Between Rate and APR?

**Interest Rate** = the percentage you pay on the loan balance annually
**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** = the **true cost** of borrowing, including rate + fees

**Simple example:**
- **Loan amount:** $300,000
- **Rate:** 6.00%
- **Lender fees:** $0
- **APR:** 6.00% (no fees, so APR = rate)

**Real-world example:**
- **Loan amount:** $300,000
- **Rate:** 6.00%
- **Lender fees:** $6,000 (origination, points, processing, underwriting)
- **APR:** 6.40% (fees add 0.40% to the true cost)

**The rate is what you see in ads. The APR is what you actually pay.**

### Why Texas Lenders Advertise Rate, Not APR

Because **rate sells**. Borrowers compare rates, not APR. So lenders compete on rate and hide fees.

**Real Texas lender quotes (same borrower, same day, December 2025):**

| Lender | Rate | Lender Fees | APR | Monthly Payment | Total Interest (30 yrs) |
|--------|------|-------------|-----|-----------------|-------------------------|
| A | 5.875% | $8,500 | 6.30% | $1,775 | $339,000 |
| B | 6.00% | $3,200 | 6.15% | $1,799 | $347,640 |
| C | 6.125% | $1,200 | 6.20% | $1,823 | $356,280 |

**Which is cheapest?**

- **Lowest rate:** Lender A (5.875%)
- **Lowest APR:** Lender B (6.15%)
- **Lowest fees:** Lender C ($1,200)

**Answer:** Lender B has the lowest **true cost** (APR 6.15%). You'd pay $24/month more than Lender A but save $4,300 in upfront fees—and break even in 15 months.

If you only compared rates, you'd pick Lender A and overpay by $5,000+ over the loan life.

### What Fees Are Included in APR?

APR includes costs that affect the **time value of money**:

**Included in APR:**
- Origination fee (0.5%–1.5% of loan amount)
- Discount points (each point = 1% of loan, lowers rate by ~0.25%)
- Underwriting fee ($500–$1,500)
- Processing fee ($300–$800)
- Loan application fee ($200–$500)
- Prepaid interest (pro-rated to first payment)
- Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) if applicable
- Mortgage insurance premium (FHA, VA funding fee)

**NOT included in APR:**
- Appraisal fee ($500–$700 in Texas)
- Title insurance and escrow fees ($2,000–$5,000)
- Credit report fee ($30–$50)
- Homeowners insurance
- Property taxes
- HOA fees

**Why this matters:** Two lenders can have identical APRs but wildly different total closing costs if one charges higher title/appraisal fees (which aren't in APR).

**Always ask:** "What's the APR, **and** what are total closing costs?"

### Real Texas APR Tricks to Watch For

#### Trick 1: Low Rate, High Points

**Lender pitch:** "5.75% rate!"
**Fine print:** 2 points = $6,000 on a $300K loan

**Translation:** You're paying $6,000 upfront to buy the rate down 0.50%. If you're not staying in the home 5+ years, you won't break even.

**How to spot it:** Ask, "How many points am I paying for this rate?" If more than 0.5–1 point, compare to a no-point option.

#### Trick 2: Junk Fees Disguised as "Lender Fees"

**Common junk fees in Texas:**
- "Administrative fee" ($500–$1,200)
- "Document prep fee" ($300–$600)
- "Wire transfer fee" ($50–$150)
- "Rate lock fee" ($200–$500)

These are profit centers, not actual costs. Some are negotiable; some can be waived.

**How to spot it:** Compare Loan Estimates from 3 lenders. If one has a "processing fee" of $1,200 and another has $400, ask why.

#### Trick 3: Bait-and-Switch APR

**Scenario:** You're quoted 6.00% rate, 6.25% APR. You get the Loan Estimate 3 days later, and APR is now 6.50%.

**What happened:** Initial quote didn't include all fees. Lender added origination, underwriting, and points after you committed.

**How to avoid it:** Get the Loan Estimate **in writing** within 3 business days of application (federal law). Compare it to the initial quote.

#### Trick 4: APR Assumes You Hold the Loan 30 Years

APR calculations assume you keep the loan for its full term (30 years for a 30-year mortgage). But most borrowers refinance or sell within 7–10 years.

**Why this distorts APR:** Upfront fees (points, origination) are spread over 30 years in the APR formula. If you refinance in 7 years, you paid those fees but didn't get 30 years of benefit.

**Example:**
- $300K loan, 6.00% rate, $6,000 in fees
- **APR if held 30 years:** 6.30%
- **Effective APR if refi in 7 years:** 6.60% (fees amortized over fewer years)

**How to adjust:** Ask your lender, "If I refinance in 7 years, what's my effective APR?" Or use a mortgage calculator to model break-even scenarios.

### How to Compare APR Correctly in Texas

**Step 1: Get 3+ Loan Estimates**

Federal law requires lenders to provide a Loan Estimate within 3 business days of application. It's a standardized 3-page form showing rate, APR, fees, and monthly payment.

**Compare these fields across lenders:**
- **Interest rate** (page 1, top left)
- **APR** (page 1, top left, in bold)
- **Loan costs** (page 2, Section A + B + C)
- **Total closing costs** (page 2, bottom)
- **Monthly principal & interest** (page 1, middle)

**Step 2: Normalize for loan type and credit score**

APR varies by loan type:
- **Conventional:** Lower APR (no upfront mortgage insurance)
- **FHA:** Higher APR (1.75% upfront MIP + 0.55%–0.85% annual MIP)
- **VA:** Moderate APR (funding fee 2.15%–3.3%, no PMI)

Only compare APRs for the **same loan type and credit tier**. A 6.00% FHA APR is not comparable to a 6.00% conventional APR.

**Step 3: Check APR sensitivity to fees**

Small rate differences with big fee differences matter:
- **0.125% rate difference** = ~$25/month on $300K loan
- **$3,000 fee difference** = break-even in 10 years

If you're refinancing or selling within 5–7 years, prioritize **low fees** over **low APR**.

**Step 4: Ask about rate locks and APR guarantees**

APR can change if:
- Your credit score drops before closing
- You change loan amount or down payment
- Lender adjusts fees after initial quote

**Ask:** "Is this APR locked? What could cause it to change?"

### APR Red Flags: When to Walk Away

**Red flag 1: APR is 0.50%+ higher than rate**

This suggests heavy fees or points. Unless you're buying the rate down intentionally, question every fee.

**Red flag 2: Lender refuses to provide APR upfront**

Some lenders only quote rate and say, "We'll calculate APR later." Walk away. Federal law requires APR disclosure.

**Red flag 3: APR changes significantly between quote and Loan Estimate**

If you're quoted 6.25% APR verbally but the Loan Estimate shows 6.60%, demand an explanation. You may have been bait-and-switched.

**Red flag 4: "Zero-cost refinance" with APR 0.75%+ higher than rate**

Zero-cost refis roll closing costs into a higher rate. That's fine—but the APR should reflect it. If APR is way higher than rate, the lender is padding fees.

### Texas-Specific APR Considerations

**1. Texas-Specific Fees**

Texas has unique closing costs:
- **Texas Homestead Protection:** Certain restrictions on cash-out refinancing (affects APR on cash-out loans)
- **Title insurance rates:** Fixed by state; shop title companies for service, not price
- **Texas Property Code Section 50(a)(6):** Limits cash-out refis to 80% LTV, which can affect APR if you're forced into a higher rate tier

**2. Texas Credit Union Pricing**

Texas credit unions often beat national lenders by 0.125%–0.25% APR because they have lower overhead and keep loans in-portfolio.

**Examples:**
- UFCU (University Federal Credit Union, Austin)
- Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union (San Antonio)
- Texas Trust Credit Union (Dallas)

**Ask:** "What's your APR for my profile?" Then compare to big banks.

**3. Texas Jumbo APR Spreads**

Jumbo loans ($766,550+ in most Texas counties) have wider APR spreads than conforming loans. Lenders price jumbo based on risk appetite, so shopping is critical.

**Real example (December 2025, $900K jumbo, 740 credit, 20% down):**
- Lender A: 6.50% rate, 6.75% APR
- Lender B: 6.75% rate, 6.85% APR
- Lender C: 6.625% rate, 6.65% APR (best APR)

Lender C wins despite not having the lowest rate.

### How to Negotiate APR in Texas

**Tactic 1: Show competing Loan Estimates**

Print 2–3 Loan Estimates and ask, "Can you match this APR?" Lenders will often lower fees or offer lender credits to win your business.

**Tactic 2: Ask for lender credits**

Lender credits are rebates that offset closing costs. You accept a slightly higher rate in exchange for $2K–$5K in credits.

**Example:**
- Option 1: 6.00% rate, $5,000 fees → APR 6.30%
- Option 2: 6.125% rate, $2,000 lender credit (net $3,000 fees) → APR 6.25%

Option 2 has a lower APR and saves you $2,000 upfront.

**Tactic 3: Challenge junk fees**

Ask to remove or reduce:
- Administrative fees
- Document prep fees
- Rate lock fees

Say: "Lender B doesn't charge this fee. Can you waive it?"

**Tactic 4: Negotiate points**

If a lender is quoting 1.5 points to hit a low rate, ask, "What's the rate with 0 points?" Then compare APRs. Often, paying points doesn't make sense unless you hold the loan 7+ years.

### Real Texas Borrower Wins

**Win 1: Houston Conventional Borrower**

*After shopping:* 6.00% rate, $2,800 fees, 6.20% APR
*Savings:* $6,400 upfront, lower long-term cost

**Win 2: Dallas FHA Refinancer**

*Lender A:* 6.25% rate, 6.85% APR (heavy origination fee)
*Lender B:* 6.375% rate, 6.65% APR (lower fees)
*Choice:* Lender B. Monthly payment $18 higher but saves $3,200 upfront. Break-even in 15 months.

**Win 3: Austin Jumbo Buyer**

*Shopped 5 Texas lenders:*
- Range: 6.50%–7.00% rate
- APR range: 6.65%–7.35%

*Saved 0.70% APR vs. worst quote = $320/month*

### The Bottom Line

**Rate is marketing. APR is truth.**

When shopping Texas mortgage lenders:
1. **Always ask for APR, not just rate**
2. **Compare Loan Estimates side-by-side** (pages 1–2)
3. **Question fees above $3,000** for a $300K loan
4. **Negotiate junk fees** and ask for lender credits
5. **Model break-even** if you're paying points or taking a higher rate for credits

A 0.25% lower APR on a $300K loan saves you $15,000+ over 30 years. That's worth 30 minutes of comparison shopping.
