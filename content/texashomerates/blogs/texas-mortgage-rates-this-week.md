## Texas Mortgage Rates This Week: What's Moving and Why

Mortgage rates in Texas shifted this week as the Fed signaled continued vigilance on inflation and the 10-year Treasury yield climbed 15 basis points. Here's what Texas borrowers need to know right now—and when to lock.

### Current Texas Rate Snapshot (Week of January 10, 2026)

**Conventional (740+ credit, 20% down):**
- 30-year fixed: 6.125%–6.375% (APR 6.25%–6.50%)
- 15-year fixed: 5.50%–5.75% (APR 5.65%–5.90%)

**FHA (3.5% down, 680+ credit):**
- 30-year fixed: 6.25%–6.625% (APR 6.45%–6.85%)

**VA (0% down, 720+ credit):**
- 30-year fixed: 5.875%–6.25% (APR 6.00%–6.40%)

**Jumbo ($766,550+, 740+ credit, 20% down):**
- 30-year fixed: 6.50%–7.00% (APR 6.65%–7.20%)

*Rates vary by lender, credit tier, and loan-to-value. APR includes typical Texas lender fees.*

### What Moved Rates This Week

**1. 10-Year Treasury Yield Climbed**

The 10-year Treasury yield rose from 4.25% to 4.40% this week after stronger-than-expected jobs data. Mortgage rates track the 10-year closely—when it rises, mortgage rates follow within 24–48 hours.

**Why this matters:** If you were quoted 6.00% conventional on Monday, the same lender likely quoted 6.25% by Friday. Waiting cost borrowers 0.25% (roughly $50/month on a $300K loan).

**2. Fed Commentary Stayed Hawkish**

The Fed reiterated its commitment to 2% inflation, signaling no rate cuts in Q1 2026. This keeps upward pressure on long-term rates, including mortgages.

**Translation:** Don't expect dramatic rate drops in the next 30–60 days. If you're closing soon, lock now to avoid further increases.

**3. Texas Housing Demand Stayed Strong**

Houston, Dallas, and Austin metros saw inventory remain tight, keeping local lender pricing competitive. San Antonio saw slight softening, which some lenders reflected in 0.125% lower pricing.

**Takeaway:** Local market conditions matter. Shop multiple Texas lenders to see regional pricing differences.

### Should You Lock or Float This Week?

**Lock if:**
- You're closing in 30–45 days (rates could climb another 0.125%–0.25%)
- You have a strong rate quote today (6.25% or below for conventional)
- The 10-year Treasury is trending upward (it is right now)
- You want certainty and peace of mind

**Float if:**
- You're closing in 60+ days and have float-down options
- You're betting on a Fed policy shift (risky in current environment)
- Your lender offers a rate cap or renegotiation clause
- You're comfortable with volatility risk

**Our take:** Markets are showing upward pressure. Unless you have a strong reason to float (like a Fed meeting coming with expected dovish pivot), locking now protects you from further increases.

### How Credit Tiers Affect Your Texas Rate

The rates above assume strong credit (720–740+). Here's how credit tiers shift pricing in Texas:

- **780+ credit:** Base pricing (rates shown above)
- **760–779:** Add 0.125%–0.25%
- **740–759:** Add 0.25%–0.375%
- **720–739:** Add 0.375%–0.50%
- **700–719:** Add 0.50%–0.75%
- **680–699:** Add 0.75%–1.00%
- **660–679:** Add 1.00%–1.50%
- **640–659:** Add 1.50%–2.50% (if approved)

**Example:** If you have a 690 credit score, add 0.75% to conventional pricing. Your rate would be 6.875%–7.125% instead of 6.125%–6.375%.

**Action step:** Check your credit score and see if you're close to the next tier (e.g., 718 → 721). A small improvement can save thousands.

### APR vs. Rate: Why Texas Borrowers Get Confused

Most ads show the **rate** (e.g., "6.00% conventional"). But the **APR** (Annual Percentage Rate) includes:
- Lender origination fees
- Discount points
- Underwriting and processing fees
- Prepaid interest and escrows

**Example:**
- **Lender A:** 6.00% rate, $3,500 fees → APR 6.25%
- **Lender B:** 6.125% rate, $1,200 fees → APR 6.20%

Lender B's APR is lower despite the higher rate. That's the real cost.

**Always ask:** "What's the APR, and what fees are included?"

### Texas Rate Predictions: Next 30 Days

Based on current Fed policy, Treasury trends, and inflation data:

**Likely scenario (60% probability):** Rates hold steady or rise 0.125%–0.25%. The Fed is not cutting soon, and the 10-year Treasury is trending up.

**Best-case scenario (25% probability):** Rates drop 0.125% if inflation data surprises lower or geopolitical events push investors into bonds.

**Worst-case scenario (15% probability):** Rates climb 0.50%+ if inflation re-accelerates or the Fed signals more tightening.

**Our recommendation:** If you're comfortable with today's rate, lock. The risk-reward favors locking over floating right now.

### How to Track Texas Rates Daily

Don't rely on weekly snapshots. Rates change daily. Here's how to stay informed:

1. **Check the 10-year Treasury yield daily** (Google "10-year Treasury yield" or visit FRED Economic Data)
2. **Watch Fed announcements** (next FOMC meeting: January 28–29, 2026)
3. **Compare APR from 3+ Texas lenders** (use Browse Lenders to shop without multiple hard inquiries)
4. **Set rate alerts** (some lenders and rate-tracking sites send daily updates)

### Lock Timing Playbook for Texas Borrowers

**If you're buying:**
- **30–45 days to close:** Lock now. Markets favor locking.
- **60+ days to close:** Float with a rate cap or float-down option. Monitor 10-year Treasury and lock if it breaks 4.50%.

**If you're refinancing:**
- **Break-even < 18 months:** Lock if current rates save you money vs. your existing rate.
- **Break-even > 24 months:** Wait and see if rates drop 0.25%–0.50% in Q2 2026.

### Real Texas Borrower Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Houston First-Time Buyer**

*Profile:* 720 credit, 5% down, $325K purchase
*Conventional rate quoted Monday:* 6.25%
*Same lender Friday:* 6.50%
*Action:* Should have locked Monday. Waiting cost $55/month.

**Scenario 2: Dallas Refinancer**

*Profile:* 760 credit, 25% equity, $400K loan
*Current rate:* 7.25% (2022 lock)
*Refi rate today:* 6.125%
*Savings:* $365/month
*Action:* Lock immediately. Break-even is 8 months; this is a no-brainer.

**Scenario 3: Austin Jumbo Buyer**

*Profile:* 780 credit, 25% down, $950K purchase
*Jumbo rate:* 6.75%
*Action:* Shop 3+ jumbo lenders. Spreads are wide (6.50%–7.25%). Lock with best APR.

### The Bottom Line

Texas mortgage rates are holding in the 6.00%–6.75% range for conventional and FHA, with VA slightly lower and jumbo higher. Markets show upward pressure, not downward.

**Key actions this week:**
1. Check your credit tier—improving 20–40 points can save $50+/month
2. Compare APR, not just rate—lender fees vary wildly
3. Lock if you're closing soon—risk-reward favors locking over floating
4. Monitor the 10-year Treasury—it's your rate compass
