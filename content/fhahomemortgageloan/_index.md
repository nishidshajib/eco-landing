**FHA home mortgage loans** help first-time buyers and borrowers with <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit scores</a> achieve homeownership with just 3.5% down payment and flexible qualification standards. Unlike conventional loans requiring 620-640+ credit and 10-20% down, FHA accepts credit scores as low as 580 and allows 100% gift funds for down payment.

FHA qualification varies by credit tier: 580-619 requires 10% down, 620-639 qualifies for 3.5% down with some lenders, 640+ qualifies for standard 3.5% down with most lenders. Understanding which tier you qualify for and how to improve your credit score 20-60 points in 2-4 months can save $13,000 in down payment (moving from 10% to 3.5%) or $3,000-$5,000 in lower interest rates over 5 years.
