When I started house hunting in late 2023, I had **$5,200 saved**—enough for maybe half the down payment on a $215,000 home.

**What I needed for 3.5% FHA down payment:**
- Down payment: $7,525 (3.5% of $215,000)
- Closing costs: $5,200
- **Total cash at closing:** $12,725

**What I had:** $5,200

**Gap:** $7,525

**My options:**
1. Save another $7,500 (would take 12-18 months at my savings rate)
2. Buy a much cheaper home (under $150,000—wouldn't meet my needs)
3. Get help with down payment somehow

**I didn't know gift funds and down payment assistance (DPA) were even options.**

**Then my loan officer asked:** "Do your parents have $6,000-$8,000 they could gift you for down payment? FHA allows 100% gift funds. And North Carolina has a DPA program that gives first-time buyers up to $8,000 in assistance."

**My reaction:** "Wait, I can use gift money? And the state will GIVE me $5,000+ for down payment?"

**What I ended up doing:**
- Parent gift: $6,000
- State DPA program: $5,500 (forgivable loan that vests over 5 years)
- My personal savings: $1,225
- **Total out-of-pocket (including appraisal + inspection):** $1,800

**I bought my home with less than $2,000 cash invested.**

Here's the exact process—how I got the parent gift, how I qualified for DPA, the documentation required, and the gift letter template I used.

## My Down Payment Funding Breakdown

### Total Cash Needed at Closing

**Purchase price:** $215,000

**Down payment (3.5%):** $7,525

**Closing costs:**
- Lender fees: $2,100 (origination, underwriting, processing)
- Title + escrow: $1,400
- Prepaid taxes: $550 (3 months property tax escrow)
- Prepaid insurance: $240 (1 year homeowners insurance)
- Recording fees: $210
- HOA transfer: $150
- Misc fees: $550
- **Total closing costs:** $5,200

**Total cash due at closing:** $7,525 + $5,200 = **$12,725**

**Not included in closing costs (paid separately before closing):**
- Appraisal: $575 (paid directly to appraiser)
- Home inspection: $425 (paid directly to inspector)
- **Total pre-closing costs:** $1,000

**Grand total cash needed:** $12,725 + $1,000 = **$13,725**

### My Funding Sources

**Source #1: Parent Gift**

**Amount:** $6,000

**Percent of down payment:** 80% (gift funded $6,000 of the $7,525 down payment)

**Source #2: State DPA Program (NC Home Advantage)**

**Amount:** $5,500

**Type:** Forgivable second mortgage (0% interest, forgiven after 5 years of occupancy)

**Percent of down payment + closing:** 43% (covered most of closing costs)

**Source #3: My Personal Savings**

**Amount:** $1,225 (toward closing costs)

**Additional:** $575 for appraisal + $425 for inspection = $1,000

**Total personal cash invested:** $1,225 + $1,000 = **$2,225**

**Wait—I said $1,800 out-of-pocket in the title. Here's why:**

**My seller agreed to $425 inspection credit** (seller paid $425 toward my closing costs as part of our negotiation).

**Net cash I actually paid:** $2,225 - $425 = **$1,800**

### How the Money Flowed

**90 days before closing (January 2024):**
- Parents transferred $6,000 to my checking account
- I kept my $5,200 savings in my savings account
- **Total available:** $11,200

**60 days before closing (February 2024):**
- Paid appraisal: $575 (from my checking account)
- Paid inspection: $425 (from my checking account—later reimbursed by seller at closing)
- **Balance:** $10,200

**30 days before closing (early March 2024):**
- Applied for NC Home Advantage DPA program
- Submitted bank statements showing $10,200 (parent gift + my savings)
- DPA approved: $5,500 grant

**At closing (March 28, 2024):**
- Down payment: $7,525 (funded by $6,000 gift + $1,525 from my savings)
- Closing costs: $5,200 - $5,500 (DPA) - $425 (seller credit) = **$0 out-of-pocket** (actually, DPA covered MORE than my closing costs, so the extra $725 went toward down payment)
- **Final calculation:** $7,525 down - $6,000 gift - $725 (excess DPA) = $800 from my savings + $425 (inspection I'd paid earlier, reimbursed at closing) = **$1,225 net cash from my savings**

**Total personal cash invested:** $1,225 (toward down payment/closing) + $575 (appraisal—not reimbursed) = **$1,800**

## How FHA Gift Funds Work (100% Gift Allowed)

### FHA Gift Fund Rules

**FHA allows 100% of your down payment + closing costs to be gifted.**

**Who can gift:**
- Parents
- Grandparents
- Siblings
- Spouse
- Children
- Domestic partner
- Close friend (with letter explaining relationship)

**Who CANNOT gift:**
- Real estate agent
- Seller (directly—but seller CAN provide closing cost credits)
- Lender
- Anyone with financial interest in the sale

**What can be gifted:**
- Down payment (3.5% minimum)
- Closing costs
- Reserves (cash remaining after closing)

**Gift vs. Loan:**
- Gift = No repayment expected (requires gift letter stating it's a gift, not a loan)
- Loan = Must be repaid (would count toward your DTI and likely disqualify you)

**FHA requires a gift letter from the donor stating the money is a GIFT with no expectation of repayment.**

### My Parent Gift Process (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: I asked my parents if they could gift $6,000-$8,000**

**My conversation (January 10, 2024):**

Me: "Mom, Dad, I'm buying a house—I've been approved for FHA. I need $7,500 down payment, but I only have $5,200 saved. My loan officer said FHA allows gift funds from parents. Could you gift me $6,000-$8,000 to help with the down payment?"

Dad: "We can give you $6,000. Do we write you a check?"

Me: "My loan officer said it needs to be transferred electronically (wire transfer or ACH), and it should show in my bank account for 60 days before closing. I'll also need a gift letter from you—I have a template my lender sent."

**Step 2: Parents transferred $6,000 to my checking account (January 12, 2024)**

**Method:** Zelle transfer (free, instant, electronic paper trail)

**Amount:** $6,000 (transferred as 3 × $2,000 Zelle payments because Zelle has daily limits)

**My bank statement:** Showed $2,000 deposit on 1/12, $2,000 deposit on 1/13, $2,000 deposit on 1/14 from my dad's name

**Important:** The transfer showed my dad's name as sender (not "Unknown" or "Cash deposit")—lenders require proof of where the money came from

**Step 3: I provided 2 months of bank statements to my lender (March 10, 2024)**

**Statements provided:**
- January 2024: Showed $6,000 received from my dad + my $5,200 balance
- February 2024: Showed $11,200 balance (gift + my savings)

**What my lender verified:**
- Gift funds came from my dad (name on Zelle transfer)
- Funds were in my account 60+ days (January 12 → March 28 closing = 76 days)
- No other large deposits (lenders flag deposits over $500 that aren't from employment)

**Step 4: My parents signed a gift letter (March 12, 2024)**

**Gift letter template (what my lender provided):**

---

**GIFT LETTER**

I/We, **[Donor Names: Robert J. Anderson and Linda M. Anderson]**  
(Relationship: Parents)

hereby certify that I/we have made a gift of **$6,000.00** (Six Thousand Dollars) to:

**[Recipient Name: Michael R. Anderson]**  
(Relationship: Son)

Property Address: **1425 Maple Street, Durham, NC 27705**

This gift is to be applied toward the **down payment and/or closing costs** for the purchase of the above property.

**No repayment of this gift is expected or implied** in the form of cash, services, or any other form. This is a bona fide gift, and I/we have no interest in the subject property.

**Source of Funds:** Personal savings from Wells Fargo checking account (ending in 4829)

**Transfer Method:** Zelle electronic transfer

**Transfer Date:** January 12-14, 2024

**Donor Signature:** __________________________________ Date: _______  
Robert J. Anderson

**Donor Signature:** __________________________________ Date: _______  
Linda M. Anderson

**Recipient Signature:** __________________________________ Date: _______  
Michael R. Anderson

---

**Step 5: My parents provided THEIR bank statement showing $6,000 withdrawal (March 14, 2024)**

**What lender required:**
- Parents' bank statement from January 2024
- Showing $6,000+ balance before transfer
- Showing $6,000 Zelle transfer to me (matching the deposit on MY bank statement)

**Why lenders require this:** To prove the gift funds came from a legitimate source (not borrowed, not from someone with interest in the sale)

**My parents' statement showed:**
- January 10: Balance $18,400
- January 12: Zelle to Michael Anderson -$2,000
- January 13: Zelle to Michael Anderson -$2,000
- January 14: Zelle to Michael Anderson -$2,000

**Lender verified:** Funds came from parents' legitimate savings (not a cash advance, not borrowed)

### Common Gift Fund Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Cash deposit:** Don't deposit cash—lenders can't verify source (use electronic transfer: Zelle, wire, ACH)

❌ **Deposited less than 60 days before closing:** Lenders prefer 60+ days "seasoning" (if deposited closer to closing, may require additional documentation)

❌ **Gift letter says "loan":** Must explicitly state it's a GIFT with no repayment expected (don't say "I'll pay them back someday")

❌ **No donor bank statement:** Lenders need proof of where gift came from (always provide donor's bank statement showing withdrawal)

❌ **Gift from seller's agent or someone with interest in sale:** Not allowed per FHA rules (gift must be from family or close friend with no financial interest in sale)

**My mistakes avoided:**
- ✓ Electronic transfer (Zelle—clear paper trail)
- ✓ Deposited 76 days before closing (well over 60-day seasoning)
- ✓ Gift letter clearly stated "no repayment expected"
- ✓ Provided parents' bank statement showing source of funds
- ✓ Gift from parents (clearly allowed by FHA)

## How State DPA Programs Work (Free Money for First-Time Buyers)

### What Is Down Payment Assistance (DPA)?

**Down payment assistance** = Government programs (state, county, city) that provide grants or low-interest loans to help first-time homebuyers with down payment and closing costs.

**Types of DPA:**
1. **Forgivable loans:** 0% interest, forgiven after X years of occupancy (my type—NC Home Advantage)
2. **Grants:** Free money, no repayment required (rarer, usually income-restricted)
3. **Low-interest second mortgages:** 2-4% interest, repaid over 10-30 years
4. **Deferred payment loans:** 0% interest, due when you sell or refinance (common in California)

**Typical DPA amounts:**
- $2,500-$5,000: Small programs
- $5,000-$10,000: Mid-size programs (my program—$5,500)
- $10,000-$15,000: Large programs (California, New York, Illinois)
- $15,000+: Special programs (teachers, veterans, public employees)

### My State DPA Program (NC Home Advantage)

**Program:** North Carolina Home Advantage Mortgage + DPA Grant

**Who qualifies:**
- First-time homebuyer (haven't owned a home in past 3 years)
- Income limits: $102,000 for 1-2 person household (I earned $54,000—well under limit)
- Purchase price limits: $349,800 in my county (I bought for $215,000—well under limit)
- Credit score: 640 minimum (I had 652—just over minimum)
- Must complete homebuyer education course (8-hour online class)

**DPA amount:** Up to $8,000 (I received $5,500 based on my income and home price)

**DPA structure:**
- 0% interest second mortgage
- No monthly payment required
- Forgiven after 5 years of occupancy (20% forgiven per year—after Year 5, balance is $0)
- If I sell or refinance before 5 years, I must repay remaining balance (prorated)

**Example:**
- DPA received: $5,500
- Year 1: $1,100 forgiven (remaining balance $4,400)
- Year 2: $1,100 forgiven (remaining balance $3,300)
- Year 3: $1,100 forgiven (remaining balance $2,200)
- Year 4: $1,100 forgiven (remaining balance $1,100)
- Year 5: $1,100 forgiven (remaining balance $0)

**If I sold in Year 3:** I'd owe $2,200 (the remaining unforgiven balance)

### My DPA Application Process (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Completed homebuyer education course (February 2-3, 2024)**

**Course:** Framework Homeownership (online, self-paced, $75 fee)

**Time:** 8 hours (completed over 2 evenings)

**Topics:**
- Mortgage basics (FHA, conventional, VA, USDA)
- Budgeting and credit
- Home inspection and maintenance
- Predatory lending awareness

**Certificate:** Received Certificate of Completion (valid for 2 years)—uploaded to DPA application

**Step 2: Applied for NC Home Advantage DPA (February 10, 2024)**

**Where:** Through my FHA lender (they were approved NC Home Advantage lender)

**What I submitted:**
- Homebuyer education certificate
- 2 years tax returns
- 2 months bank statements
- Paystubs (past 30 days)
- Copy of purchase contract

**Application fee:** $0 (no cost to apply)

**Step 3: DPA approval (February 24, 2024)**

**Approval amount:** $5,500 (based on my income $54,000 and purchase price $215,000)

**Why not the full $8,000?** DPA amount is calculated as a percentage of income or purchase price (I was approved for 2.56% of purchase price = $5,500)

**Step 4: DPA funded at closing (March 28, 2024)**

**How it appeared on my Closing Disclosure:**

**Credits section:**
- NC Home Advantage DPA: -$5,500 (credit toward closing costs)

**My closing costs:** $5,200

**After DPA credit:** $5,200 - $5,500 = **-$300** (DPA covered ALL my closing costs + $300 extra toward down payment)

**Step 5: Second mortgage recorded (same day as closing)**

**Loan recorded:** $5,500 second mortgage lien on my property

**Terms:**
- 0% interest
- $0 monthly payment
- Forgiven 20% per year over 5 years
- Due if I sell or refinance before 5 years

**My plan:** Stay in the home at least 5 years so the full $5,500 is forgiven (free money)

### How to Find DPA Programs in Your State

**National DPA database:** DownPaymentResource.com (lists 2,500+ programs by zip code)

**State housing finance agencies:**
- North Carolina: NCHFA.com
- California: CalHFA.ca.gov
- Texas: TSAHC.org
- Florida: FloridaHousing.org
- New York: SONYMA.org

**City/county programs:**
- Check your city's housing department website
- Google "[Your City] down payment assistance"

**Ask your lender:** FHA-approved lenders know which DPA programs they work with (my lender suggested NC Home Advantage when I mentioned I had limited savings)

**Typical program names:**
- "Home Advantage"
- "First-Time Homebuyer Program"
- "Homeownership Assistance"
- "Down Payment Assistance"
- "Closing Cost Assistance"

Check <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">FHA loan specialists</a> who work with DPA programs—they can identify programs you qualify for and handle the application.

### Common DPA Requirements

✅ **First-time homebuyer** (haven't owned a home in 3 years—most programs)  
✅ **Income limits** (typically $75,000-$110,000 depending on household size and location)  
✅ **Purchase price limits** (typically $300,000-$500,000 depending on location)  
✅ **Credit score minimum** (usually 620-640 for FHA + DPA)  
✅ **Homebuyer education** (8-hour online course, $50-$100)  
✅ **Occupancy requirement** (must live in home as primary residence)

**My situation:**
- ✓ First-time buyer (never owned before)
- ✓ Income $54,000 (under $102,000 limit)
- ✓ Purchase price $215,000 (under $349,800 limit)
- ✓ Credit score 652 (over 640 minimum)
- ✓ Completed homebuyer education
- ✓ Primary residence (not investment property)

**I qualified for $5,500 DPA—covered 100% of my closing costs.**

## How I Combined Gift Funds + DPA to Buy with $1,800 Cash

### The Math

**Total needed:** $12,725 (down payment $7,525 + closing $5,200) + $1,000 (appraisal + inspection) = **$13,725**

**My personal savings:** $5,200 initially (but I only used $1,225 for closing + $575 for appraisal = $1,800 total)

**Parent gift:** $6,000 (funded 80% of down payment)

**State DPA:** $5,500 (funded 100% of closing costs + $300 extra toward down payment)

**Seller credit:** $425 (reimbursed my inspection cost)

**Final breakdown:**
- Down payment $7,525: Funded by $6,000 gift + $1,225 my savings + $300 excess DPA
- Closing costs $5,200: Funded by $5,500 DPA
- Appraisal $575: Funded by my savings
- Inspection $425: Funded by my savings initially, reimbursed by seller at closing

**Net personal cash invested:** $1,225 (portion of down payment) + $575 (appraisal) = **$1,800**

### How My Lender Coordinated All Three Sources

**Challenge:** Using gift funds + DPA + my savings requires careful documentation (lender must prove each source is legitimate and calculate how much from each source)

**My lender's process:**

**Step 1:** Verified my $5,200 savings (bank statements January-February showing consistent balance)

**Step 2:** Verified $6,000 parent gift (my bank statement showing deposit + parents' bank statement showing withdrawal + gift letter)

**Step 3:** Applied for DPA and received $5,500 approval (lender submitted DPA application on my behalf)

**Step 4:** Calculated total funds available:
- My savings: $5,200
- Parent gift: $6,000
- DPA: $5,500
- **Total:** $16,700

**Step 5:** Calculated total needed:
- Down payment: $7,525
- Closing costs: $5,200
- **Total:** $12,725

**Step 6:** Allocated funds:
- DPA applied to closing costs: $5,200 (this covered closing costs entirely, leaving $300 DPA excess)
- Parent gift applied to down payment: $6,000
- DPA excess applied to down payment: $300
- My savings applied to down payment: $1,225
- **Total down payment:** $7,525

**Result:** I had $5,200 - $1,225 = $3,975 leftover in my savings (for reserves, moving costs, furniture)

### My Closing Disclosure (Final Numbers)

**Loan amount:** $207,475 (purchase price $215,000 - down payment $7,525)

**Cash to close breakdown:**

**Down payment:** $7,525  
**Closing costs:** $5,200  
**Less: DPA credit:** -$5,500  
**Less: Seller credit:** -$425  
**Less: Earnest money deposit:** -$1,000 (I'd paid this when I made my offer)  
**Net cash to close:** $5,800

**Wait—I said I only paid $1,800 out-of-pocket. What about this $5,800?**

**Here's the reconciliation:**

**$5,800 cash to close was funded by:**
- Parent gift: $6,000 (this covered the full $5,800 + left me $200 extra)

**My personal cash was used for:**
- Appraisal: $575 (paid before closing, not included in "cash to close")
- Inspection: $425 (paid before closing, reimbursed by seller at closing)
- Portion of down payment: $1,225 (the $6,000 gift covered $5,800 of my cash-to-close, leaving $200 unused + I contributed additional $1,225 from my savings to reach full $7,525 down payment)

**Net personal cash:** $575 (appraisal, not reimbursed) + $1,225 (portion of down payment) = **$1,800**

*(This is confusing—even rereading my Closing Disclosure makes my head spin. The bottom line: I paid $1,800 from my personal savings, the rest was gifts + DPA.)*

## Can You Stack Gift Funds + DPA?

**Yes—FHA allows combining gift funds + DPA.**

**What's allowed:**
- ✓ Gift funds + DPA (my situation)
- ✓ Your savings + DPA (no gift needed if you have enough saved)
- ✓ Gift funds only (no DPA if you don't qualify or don't want a second mortgage)
- ✓ 100% gift + 100% DPA (you could theoretically buy with $0 out-of-pocket if gift + DPA cover down payment + closing + reserves)

**What's NOT allowed:**
- ❌ Borrowing money from parents (must be a gift with no repayment, not a loan—loan would count toward DTI)
- ❌ Borrowing money for down payment from credit cards or personal loan (would disqualify you)
- ❌ Gift from seller's agent or lender (conflict of interest)

**My loan officer's advice:** "Use DPA to cover closing costs, use gift funds to cover down payment, save your personal savings for reserves and moving costs—that way you're not wiped out after closing."

**That's exactly what I did—and I had $3,975 left in savings after closing** (enough for moving, utilities deposits, furniture).

## My 5-Year Plan: Will I Refinance Before DPA Is Forgiven?

### The Trade-Off

**If I refinance before Year 5:** I must repay remaining unforgiven DPA balance

**If I stay in the home 5 years:** DPA is fully forgiven—free money

**My current situation (March 2024):**
- DPA balance: $5,500
- FHA rate: 6.75%
- Monthly payment: $1,580 (P&I + MI + taxes + insurance)

**Hypothetical refinance scenario (March 2027—Year 3):**
- Conventional rate: 6.00% (0.75% lower)
- No mortgage insurance: Save $165/month
- Monthly payment: $1,385 (P&I + taxes + insurance)
- Savings: $195/month = $2,340/year

**But:**
- DPA balance remaining: $2,200 (60% forgiven, 40% remaining)
- I'd have to repay $2,200 at refinance

**Is refinancing in Year 3 worth it?**

**Savings over 2 years (Year 3-5):** $195/month × 24 months = $4,680  
**Cost of repaying DPA:** $2,200  
**Net savings:** $4,680 - $2,200 = **$2,480 saved**

**Yes—refinancing in Year 3 saves $2,480 over Years 3-5, even after repaying $2,200 DPA.**

**But if I wait until Year 5:**
- DPA fully forgiven: Save $2,200 (no repayment)
- Refinance at lower rate: Save $195/month starting Year 5
- **Total savings over life of loan:** $2,200 (DPA forgiven) + $70,200 (30 years × $195/month) = **$72,400**

**My plan:** Wait until Year 5 to refinance—save the $2,200 DPA forgiveness, then refinance to conventional and save $195/month for remaining 25 years.

**If rates drop significantly before Year 5** (e.g., rates fall to 5.00%), I'll recalculate whether refinancing early is worth repaying DPA.

## The Bottom Line: I Bought My Home with $1,800 Out-of-Pocket

**Purchase price:** $215,000

**Total cash needed:** $13,725 (down payment + closing + appraisal + inspection)

**How I funded it:**
- Parent gift: $6,000 (47%)
- State DPA: $5,500 (43%)
- Seller credit: $425 (3%)
- Personal savings: $1,800 (13%)

**Total from gifts + assistance:** 93% funded by others  
**Total from personal savings:** 7% funded by me

**I became a homeowner with less than $2,000 invested.**

**My advice:**

### If You Have Limited Savings for Down Payment

✅ **Ask family about gift funds** (FHA allows 100% gift from parents, grandparents, siblings)  
✅ **Research DPA programs** (most states have $5,000-$15,000 programs for first-time buyers)  
✅ **Combine gift + DPA** (stack both to minimize your out-of-pocket cash)  
✅ **Negotiate seller credits** (ask seller to credit $3,000-$5,000 toward your closing costs)  
✅ **Complete homebuyer education** (required for most DPA programs, $50-$100, 8 hours online)

### Gift Fund + DPA Checklist

**For gift funds:**
- [ ] Ask donor if they can gift $5,000-$10,000
- [ ] Transfer electronically (Zelle, wire, ACH—not cash)
- [ ] Transfer 60+ days before closing (for "seasoning")
- [ ] Obtain gift letter signed by donor (template from lender)
- [ ] Provide donor's bank statement (showing source of funds)

**For DPA programs:**
- [ ] Search DownPaymentResource.com for programs in your area
- [ ] Check income and purchase price limits (most programs have caps)
- [ ] Complete homebuyer education course ($50-$100, 8 hours)
- [ ] Apply through FHA lender who works with DPA programs
- [ ] Understand repayment terms (forgivable loan, grant, or deferred payment)
