When I applied for an FHA loan in February 2024, I thought I'd be putting down 3.5% (the famous low-down-payment FHA benefit).

**My credit score: 597** (middle score from 591, 597, 605 across three bureaus).

**What my loan officer told me:** "Your credit score is below 620—FHA requires 10% down for credit scores between 580-619."

**My reaction:** "Wait, what? I thought FHA only required 3.5% down?"

**The reality:** FHA's down payment requirement depends on your credit score.

**580-619 credit:** 10% down payment required  
**620+ credit:** 3.5% down payment allowed

**My $200,000 home purchase:**
- **10% down (597 credit):** $20,000 down payment
- **3.5% down (620+ credit):** $7,000 down payment
- **Extra cost for my 597 credit score:** $13,000 more upfront

**My dilemma:** Should I wait 3-6 months to improve my credit to 620+ (and save $13,000 on down payment), or buy now with 10% down and accept the higher upfront cost?

**My decision:** I bought immediately with 10% down at 597 credit.

**Why I'd do it again:** Because waiting 6 months to improve my credit would've cost me MORE than $13,000 when I factored in rent increases, home appreciation, and refinance opportunities.

Here's my full analysis—what I paid with 10% down, what I would've saved with 3.5% down, and whether buying now or waiting for better credit saves more money.

## My 597 Credit Score FHA Qualification

### Why My Score Was 597

**My credit challenges:**
- Collections account: $850 medical bill from 2021 (I forgot to pay after insurance—it went to collections)
- High credit card utilization: $3,400 balance on $5,000 total limits = 68% utilization
- Short credit history: 3.5 years average account age
- Recent credit inquiries: Applied for two credit cards in 2023 (trying to increase limits—backfired)

**What was helping my credit:**
- No late payments in past 24 months (besides the medical collection from 2021)
- Car loan with 100% on-time payments (2 years old)
- Stable employment (4 years at same company)

**My three credit scores:**
- Experian: 605
- TransUnion: 597
- Equifax: 591

**Middle score:** 597 (this is what FHA uses—not highest, not average, but the middle of the three)

### FHA Approval at 597 Credit Score

**What I qualified for:**

✅ **FHA loan approved** (FHA allows credit scores as low as 580)  
❌ **3.5% down payment** (requires 620+ credit)  
✅ **10% down payment** (required for 580-619 credit scores)

**My loan details:**
- Purchase price: $200,000
- Down payment (10%): $20,000
- Loan amount: $180,000
- Upfront mortgage insurance (1.75%): $3,150 (financed into loan)
- Total loan: $183,150
- Interest rate: 7.375% (higher due to 597 credit—borrowers with 680+ credit were getting 6.50%)
- Monthly P&I: $1,279
- Annual MI (0.85%): $130/month
- Property taxes: $220/month
- Homeowners insurance: $95/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $1,724

**Cash needed at closing:**
- Down payment: $20,000
- Closing costs: $4,800
- **Total cash:** $24,800

**My savings:** $18,000 (I'd saved aggressively for 2 years—$750/month)

**Parent gift:** $7,000 (FHA allows 100% gift funds for down payment + closing)

**Out-of-pocket:** $17,800 (my $18,000 savings - $200 left over for moving costs)

## What I Would've Paid with 3.5% Down (If I'd Improved Credit to 620+)

### The 6-Month Credit Improvement Timeline

**To get from 597 to 620+ credit score, I'd need to:**

**Step 1: Settle the $850 medical collection** (adds 15-25 points once removed)

**Step 2: Pay credit cards from 68% to under 30% utilization** (adds 20-30 points)
- Current balance: $3,400
- Goal balance: $1,500 (30% of $5,000 limit)
- Paydown needed: $1,900

**Step 3: Wait for credit inquiries to age** (reduces impact after 6 months—adds 5-10 points)

**Step 4: Avoid new credit** (prevents further drops)

**Expected timeline:** 4-6 months to reach 620-625 credit score

**Estimated score after 6 months:** 625 (597 + 15 collection + 25 utilization + 8 inquiries = 645, but allowing margin for slower-than-expected improvement)

### What 3.5% Down Would've Cost

**If I waited 6 months and bought with 620+ credit:**

**Home purchase price:** $206,000 (3% appreciation over 6 months—my market was rising fast)

**FHA loan details:**
- Purchase price: $206,000 (vs. $200,000 if I bought immediately)
- Down payment (3.5%): $7,210
- Loan amount: $198,790
- Upfront MI (1.75%): $3,479 (financed)
- Total loan: $202,269
- Interest rate: 7.00% (0.375% better than my 7.375% at 597 credit)
- Monthly P&I: $1,346
- Annual MI (0.85%): $143/month
- Property taxes: $227/month (higher due to $206K price vs. $200K)
- Insurance: $98/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $1,814

**Cash needed at closing:**
- Down payment: $7,210 (vs. $20,000 at 10% down)
- Closing costs: $4,940
- **Total cash:** $12,150 (vs. $24,800 at 10% down)

**Upfront savings vs. 10% down:** $24,800 - $12,150 = **$12,650 less cash needed**

**Monthly payment comparison:**
- **My actual payment (10% down, 597 credit):** $1,724/month
- **3.5% down payment (620+ credit):** $1,814/month
- **Monthly difference:** $90/month MORE for 3.5% down (because loan balance $19,000 higher despite lower rate)

## The Hidden Costs of Waiting 6 Months

### Cost #1: Extra Rent

**My rent:** $1,380/month

**If I waited 6 months to improve credit:**
- February-July rent: $1,380 × 6 = $8,280
- Plus: Rent increase in June (lease renewal): $1,480/month × 2 months = $2,960
- **Total rent paid:** $11,240

**If I bought immediately:**
- February rent only: $1,380 (moved in March 1)
- **Total rent saved by buying immediately:** $11,240 - $1,380 = **$9,860**

### Cost #2: Home Price Appreciation

**My market:** Jacksonville, FL (home prices rising 6-8% annually in 2024)

**Monthly appreciation:** 0.5% per month (conservative estimate)

**Home price if I bought in March 2024:** $200,000

**Home price if I waited until September 2024:**
- March: $200,000
- April: $201,000 (+0.5%)
- May: $202,000
- June: $203,000
- July: $204,000
- August: $205,000
- September: $206,000
- **Total appreciation:** $6,000 (3% over 6 months)

**My down payment on $206,000 home (3.5%):** $7,210

**vs. My down payment on $200,000 home (10%):** $20,000

**Net difference:** $7,210 - $20,000 = **-$12,790** (3.5% down costs $12,790 less)

**But:** I'm financing $6,000 more because home price increased—costs me $40/month over 30 years = $14,400 total

### Cost #3: Interest Rate Environment

**Rates in March 2024:** 7.375% (my rate at 597 credit)

**Rates in September 2024:** 7.625% (rates rose 0.25% over 6 months—I couldn't have known this, but it happened)

**If I'd waited for 620+ credit but rates increased:**
- Best rate at 620+ credit in September: 7.25% (vs. 7.00% I was assuming in March)
- My rate at 597 credit in March: 7.375%
- **Rate savings by waiting:** Only 0.125% (not the 0.375% I expected)

**Monthly savings:** $25/month (instead of $67/month I was expecting)

**This was the risk of waiting:** Interest rates could rise faster than I could improve my credit.

## My 5-Year Cost Analysis: 10% Down Now vs. 3.5% Down Later

### Option 1: Buy Immediately with 10% Down (What I Did)

**Purchase price:** $200,000  
**Down payment:** $20,000  
**Loan amount:** $183,150  
**Rate:** 7.375%  
**Monthly payment:** $1,724

**First 5 years:**
- Total payments: $1,724 × 60 = $103,440
- Closing costs: $4,800
- Down payment: $20,000
- Rent paid (February only): $1,380
- **Total invested:** $129,620

**Equity after 5 years:**
- Principal paid down: $27,900 (balance reduced to $155,250)
- Home appreciation: $30,000 (home now worth $230,000 at 3% annual appreciation)
- **Total equity:** $57,900 (down payment $20,000 + paydown $27,900 + appreciation $30,000)

**Net cost after equity:** $129,620 - $57,900 = **$71,720**

### Option 2: Wait 6 Months, Buy with 3.5% Down (The Alternative)

**Purchase price:** $206,000 (after 3% appreciation)  
**Down payment:** $7,210  
**Loan amount:** $202,269  
**Rate:** 7.00% (assuming rates didn't rise—they did)  
**Monthly payment:** $1,814

**First 5 years:**
- Rent while waiting (6 months): $11,240
- Total payments: $1,814 × 54 = $97,956 (only 54 months of mortgage vs. 60)
- Closing costs: $4,940
- Down payment: $7,210
- **Total invested:** $121,346

**Equity after 5 years:**
- Principal paid down: $24,800 (balance reduced to $177,469)
- Home appreciation: $30,900 (home now worth $236,900 at 3% annual appreciation)
- **Total equity:** $55,700 (down payment $7,210 + paydown $24,800 + appreciation $30,900 + higher home value)

**Net cost after equity:** $121,346 - $55,700 = **$65,646**

### The Verdict: Which Option Cost Less?

**Option 1 (buy now, 10% down):** $71,720 net cost

**Option 2 (wait 6 months, 3.5% down):** $65,646 net cost

**Savings by waiting:** $6,074 over 5 years ($101/month average)

**WAIT—that assumes rates didn't rise and home appreciated only 3% over 6 months.**

### What ACTUALLY Happened (Real Scenario)

**In reality:**
- Interest rates rose to 7.625% by September 2024 (not 7.00%)
- Home prices in my neighborhood rose 4.5% over 6 months (not 3%)
- My landlord raised rent to $1,480 in June (not $1,380)

**Recalculated Option 2 with real numbers:**

**Purchase price:** $209,000 (4.5% appreciation over 6 months)  
**Rate:** 7.25% (best rate at 620+ credit in September, after 0.25% rate increase)  
**Monthly payment:** $1,872 (higher due to $209K price + higher rate)

**First 5 years (recalculated):**
- Rent while waiting: $11,840 (includes $1,480/month increase)
- Total payments: $1,872 × 54 = $101,088
- Closing costs: $5,020
- Down payment: $7,315 (3.5% of $209K)
- **Total invested:** $125,263

**Equity after 5 years:**
- Principal paid down: $24,200
- Home appreciation: $31,350 (home now worth $240,350)
- **Total equity:** $55,550

**Net cost after equity:** $125,263 - $55,550 = **$69,713**

**Option 1 (what I did):** $71,720 net cost  
**Option 2 (real numbers):** $69,713 net cost

**Savings by waiting with REAL numbers:** Only $2,007 over 5 years ($33/month)

**And I would've spent 6 more months renting, risked rates rising further, and paid $9,000 more for the same house.**

## Why I'm Glad I Bought with 10% Down at 597 Credit

### Reason #1: I Started Building Equity Immediately

**From March 2024 to September 2024 (6 months):**
- Principal paid down: $2,850
- Home appreciation: $6,000 (3% in 6 months)
- **Equity built:** $8,850

**If I'd waited and kept renting:**
- Equity built: $0
- Rent paid: $11,240

**Net benefit of buying immediately:** $8,850 equity vs. $11,240 rent = **$2,390 ahead by buying now**

### Reason #2: I Locked In $200,000 Price (Not $206,000-$209,000)

**Homes in my neighborhood:**
- March 2024: $200,000 (my purchase price)
- September 2024: $209,000 (4.5% appreciation)
- **I saved $9,000 by buying before prices rose**

**My down payment difference:**
- 10% down on $200K: $20,000
- 3.5% down on $209K: $7,315
- **Net: I paid $12,685 more upfront**

**But I saved $9,000 on purchase price—so real extra cost was only $3,685**

**And that $9,000 in price savings translates to $60/month lower payment = $21,600 over 30 years**

### Reason #3: I Can Refinance in 2-3 Years

**My refinance plan:**

**Current situation (March 2024):**
- Credit score: 597
- Rate: 7.375%
- Loan balance: $183,150
- Home value: $200,000
- Equity: 10% ($20,000 down)

**Goal (March 2027—3 years later):**
- Credit score: 680+ (improve by paying cards, aging accounts, settling collections)
- Loan balance: $167,500 (paid down $15,650 over 3 years)
- Home value: $230,000 (3% annual appreciation)
- Equity: 27% ($62,500)

**Refinance to conventional loan:**
- New rate: 6.25% (at 680+ credit, conventional)
- New monthly payment: $1,031 P&I + $0 MI (conventional has no MI at 20%+ equity) + $253 taxes + $106 insurance = **$1,390/month**
- Current FHA payment: $1,724/month
- **Monthly savings:** $334/month = $4,008/year

**My 10% down payment bought me faster equity buildup** (27% equity in 3 years vs. 18% equity with 3.5% down)—letting me refinance sooner and eliminate mortgage insurance.

**If I'd done 3.5% down, I'd need 4-5 years to hit 20% equity** (instead of 3 years)—delaying refinance by 1-2 years and costing me $4,000-$8,000 in extra MI payments.

### Reason #4: I Avoided the Risk of Rates Rising Further

**FHA rates in March 2024:** 7.375% (my rate)

**FHA rates in September 2024:** 7.625% (0.25% higher)

**FHA rates in December 2024:** 7.875% (0.50% higher than March)

**If I'd waited until December to buy (6 months of credit improvement + 3 months of house hunting):**
- Rate at 620+ credit: 7.50% (best available)
- Monthly payment on $210,000 home: $1,920/month
- **vs. my $1,724/month = $196/month more = $70,560 over 30 years**

**Buying in March at 597 credit locked in a 7.375% rate BEFORE rates rose to 7.875%.**

**Even with my "bad" 597 credit score, I got a better rate than borrowers with 640+ credit who waited until December.**

## The Break-Even Analysis: When Does 3.5% Down Beat 10% Down?

### When 3.5% Down Saves More Money

✅ **Home prices are stable or declining** (no rush to buy before appreciation)  
✅ **Interest rates are stable or falling** (no risk of rates rising while you improve credit)  
✅ **Rent is cheap and stable** (under $1,200/month, lease locked in)  
✅ **You can improve credit quickly** (620+ in 2-3 months)  
✅ **You don't have 10% saved** (need to preserve cash for emergencies)

**Example:** If home prices were flat and rates were falling, waiting 3 months to improve from 597 to 625 credit would save $12,000 upfront (10% vs. 3.5% down) with no offsetting costs.

### When 10% Down Saves More Money

✅ **Home prices are rising fast** (0.5%+ per month)  
✅ **Interest rates are rising** (risk of higher rates while you wait)  
✅ **Rent is high and increasing** ($1,400+/month with renewal increases)  
✅ **You have 10% saved** (paying 10% doesn't drain emergency fund)  
✅ **You plan to refinance in 3-5 years** (10% down gets you to 20% equity faster for conventional refinance)

**My situation had ALL FIVE factors**—which is why 10% down at 597 credit was the right decision despite costing $13,000 more upfront.

## What I'd Do Differently If I Could Go Back

### If I'd Known My Credit Score Was 597 (Instead of Assuming 620+)

**What I'd have done 6 months earlier:**
- Paid off the $850 medical collection immediately (adds 15-25 points)
- Paid credit cards from 68% to 30% utilization (adds 20-30 points)
- Avoided the two credit card applications in 2023 (prevented 10-point drop)

**If I'd done this 6 months before house hunting:**
- Score would've been 630-640 (instead of 597)
- I'd have qualified for 3.5% down
- I'd have saved $13,000 upfront

**Lesson learned:** Check your credit score 6-12 months BEFORE you plan to buy a home—not when you're ready to apply.

**Check your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">real FICO middle credit score</a>** now (not Credit Karma—that's VantageScore, not the FICO score mortgage lenders use).

### If I'd Had Only $10,000 Saved (Not $18,000)

**I wouldn't have been able to buy with 10% down**—I needed $24,800 cash at closing.

**Options if I had limited savings:**
- **Option 1:** Wait 4-6 months to improve credit to 620+ and do 3.5% down ($12,150 cash needed)
- **Option 2:** Use gift funds (FHA allows 100% gift funds—my parents could've gifted the full $20,000 down payment)
- **Option 3:** Combine gift funds + down payment assistance (some states offer $5,000-$15,000 DPA for first-time buyers)

**Lesson learned:** If you don't have 10% saved, improving your credit to 620+ for 3.5% down makes more financial sense than waiting years to save more cash.

### If Rates Had Been Falling (Not Rising)

**In a falling-rate environment, waiting to improve credit makes more sense:**
- Improve 597 → 625 in 4 months
- Rates fall from 7.375% to 7.00%
- Save $12,000 on down payment (3.5% vs. 10%)
- Save $67/month on payment (lower rate)

**Total savings:** $12,000 upfront + $24,000 over 30 years (lower payment) = **$36,000**

**But in 2024, rates were RISING—so buying early at a higher credit score beat waiting for better credit at even higher rates.**

## The Bottom Line: My 597 Credit Score Cost Me $13,000—But Saved Me $21,000

**What I paid extra for 597 credit:**
- $13,000 more down payment (10% vs. 3.5%)
- 0.375% higher interest rate (7.375% vs. 7.00% at 620+ credit)
- $95/month higher payment = $34,200 over 30 years

**Total cost of 597 credit:** $47,200 over 30 years

**What I saved by buying immediately:**
- $9,860 saved in rent (avoided 6 months extra rent)
- $9,000 saved on purchase price (bought at $200K before rising to $209K)
- $2,850 principal paid down (while I would've been renting)
- **Total savings:** $21,710

**Net cost of buying at 597 vs. waiting for 620+:** $47,200 - $21,710 = **$25,490 over 30 years**

**But:**
- I can refinance in 3 years (once credit improves and equity hits 20%)
- I locked in housing costs (rent would've increased 3-5% annually)
- I built $57,900 equity in 5 years (vs. $0 equity if I kept renting)

**I'd do it again—because buying at 597 credit with 10% down got me into homeownership before prices and rates rose further.**

**My advice:**

### If Your Credit Score Is 580-619

✅ **You CAN get FHA approved** (10% down required)  
✅ **Run the math:** Compare 10% down now vs. 3.5% down after improving credit  
✅ **Consider market conditions:** Rising prices + rising rates = buy now, stable/falling = wait  
✅ **Plan to refinance:** 10% down gets you to 20% equity faster (eliminate MI sooner)
