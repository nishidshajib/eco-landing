When I started house hunting in March 2024, my credit score was **618**.

**My situation:**
- Renting: $1,450/month (going up to $1,595 in June—10% increase)
- Savings: $12,000 (enough for 3.5% down + closing costs)
- Income: $58,000/year ($4,833/month gross)
- Debt: $385/month (car payment $285, credit cards $100 minimums)

**My question:** Should I buy now with my 618 credit score, or wait 3-4 months to improve my score to 660+?

**What my loan officer told me:** "You qualify for FHA at 618—let's get you out of that rent trap."

**What nobody told me:** My 618 credit score would cost me **$63/month more** than if I'd waited to improve my score to 660.

**Over 5 years, that's $3,780 in extra interest.**

Here's my decision analysis—what I paid to buy at 618, what I would've paid if I'd waited to improve my score, and whether buying immediately or waiting 3 months saves more money.

## My FHA Qualification at 618 Credit Score

### What I Qualified For

**Credit score:** 618 (middle score from 612, 618, 625 across three bureaus)

**FHA approval:** Yes, with conditions

**Down payment required:** Most lenders wanted 10% down (580-619 tier), but I found one lender accepting 3.5% down at 620-639 with compensating factors.

**My compensating factors:**
- 3.5 years stable employment (same employer since 2020)
- $12,000 savings (4 months reserves after down payment and closing)
- Debt-to-income 38% (below 43% limit)
- Perfect 24-month rent payment history (verified by landlord)

**Interest rate quoted:** 7.25% (compared to 6.75% for 640+ borrowers, 6.50% for 660+ borrowers)

**Home I was buying:** $215,000 purchase price

**FHA loan details:**
- Purchase price: $215,000
- Down payment (3.5%): $7,525
- Loan amount: $207,475
- Upfront MI (1.75%): $3,631 (financed into loan)
- Total loan: $211,106
- Interest rate: 7.25%
- Monthly P&I: $1,441
- Annual MI (0.85%): $150/month
- Property taxes: $245/month
- Homeowners insurance: $110/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $1,946

**Cash needed at closing:** $7,525 down + $5,200 closing costs = $12,725

**I had $12,000 saved—came up $725 short.**

**Solution:** My parents gifted me $1,000 (FHA allows 100% gift funds). Total out-of-pocket: $11,725 personal savings + $1,000 gift.

### Why I Wanted to Buy Immediately

**Reason #1: Rent was increasing**

My lease was ending in June. Renewal options:
- $1,595/month (10% increase—landlord's offer)
- $1,650/month for month-to-month (if I delayed while improving credit)

**Extra rent cost if I waited 3 months:** $1,650 × 3 = $4,950

**Reason #2: I was "throwing money away" on rent**

At $1,450/month rent, I was spending $17,400/year with zero equity.

If I bought, my $1,946 mortgage would be $5,928/year more than rent—but I'd be building equity and locking in housing costs.

**Reason #3: Home prices were rising**

In my market (Raleigh, NC), home prices were increasing 0.5-1% per month (6-12% annually).

If I waited 3 months, my $215,000 home could be $218,000-$221,000 (3-month appreciation).

**Extra cost if prices rose:** $3,000-$6,000 higher purchase price.

**My decision:** Buy now at 618 credit score and accept the 7.25% rate.

## What I Actually Paid (618 Credit Score, 7.25% Rate)

### First-Year Costs

**Closing costs:** $12,725 (down payment + closing)

**Monthly payment:** $1,946 ($1,441 P&I + $150 MI + $245 taxes + $110 insurance)

**First-year total housing cost:** $12,725 closing + ($1,946 × 12 months) = **$36,077**

**If I'd kept renting:** $1,450 × 12 = $17,400

**Extra cost Year 1 (buying vs. renting):** $36,077 - $17,400 = **$18,677 more to own**

**But:** I built $7,200 equity (principal paydown in Year 1) + $6,500 appreciation (home now worth $221,500 after 3% appreciation).

**Net equity:** $13,700

**True cost Year 1 after equity:** $18,677 extra - $13,700 equity = **$4,977 net cost to own vs. rent**

### Five-Year Costs (618 Score, 7.25% Rate)

**Total paid over 5 years:**
- Principal and interest: $1,441 × 60 = $86,460
- Mortgage insurance: $150 × 60 = $9,000
- Property taxes: $245 × 60 = $14,700
- Insurance: $110 × 60 = $6,600
- **Total payments:** $116,760

**Add closing costs:** $12,725

**Total invested:** $129,485

**Equity built:**
- Principal paydown: $42,100 (paid down balance from $211,106 to $169,006)
- Home appreciation: $32,250 (home worth $247,250 after 15% appreciation over 5 years)
- **Total equity:** $74,350

**Net cost after equity:** $129,485 - $74,350 = **$55,135 net cost over 5 years**

**If I'd kept renting 5 years:** $1,450 × 12 = $17,400/year increasing 3% annually = $89,880 total (zero equity)

**Buying vs. renting savings:** $89,880 rent - $55,135 net ownership cost = **$34,745 saved by buying**

## What I Would've Paid If I'd Improved My Score First (660 Credit, 6.50% Rate)

### The 3-Month Credit Improvement Plan

**Starting score:** 618

**Goal score:** 660 (42-point improvement in 3 months)

**Strategy #1: Pay down credit cards**

My credit card balances: $2,800 on $4,200 total limits = 67% utilization (very high)

**Goal:** Get under 30% utilization (under $1,260 balance)

**Required paydown:** $1,540

**My plan:** Pay $515/month extra for 3 months (beyond minimum $100/month)

**Impact:** 67% to 30% utilization = 25-35 point credit boost in 90 days

**Strategy #2: Become authorized user**

My mom's credit card:
- Age: 14 years (vs. my 3-year average)
- Limit: $18,000
- Balance: $600 (3% utilization)
- Payment history: 100% on-time

**Impact:** Adds 7-12 points in 30-60 days (once account reports to my credit)

**Strategy #3: Dispute error**

My credit report showed a late payment on a utility bill from 2 years ago that I don't recognize.

**Action:** File dispute with all three bureaus

**Impact:** If removed, adds 8-12 points

**Total potential improvement:** 25-35 (utilization) + 7-12 (authorized user) + 8-12 (dispute) = **40-59 points**

**New score projection:** 618 + 40-59 = **658-677** (target 660+ achieved)

### Cost of Waiting 3 Months

**Extra rent (June-August):** $1,650 × 3 = $4,950 (month-to-month premium while waiting)

**Home price appreciation:** $215,000 × 1% = $2,150 (assumed 1% quarterly appreciation)

**Total delay cost:** $4,950 rent + $2,150 appreciation = **$7,100**

**But:** I'd qualify for 6.50% rate (vs. 7.25%) and save $63/month.

### What I Would've Paid at 660 Credit Score (6.50% Rate)

**Home purchase price:** $217,150 (after 1% appreciation during 3-month wait)

**FHA loan details:**
- Purchase price: $217,150
- Down payment (3.5%): $7,600
- Loan amount: $209,550
- Upfront MI (1.75%): $3,667 (financed)
- Total loan: $213,217
- Interest rate: 6.50% (vs. 7.25%)
- Monthly P&I: $1,348 (vs. $1,441 at 7.25%)
- Annual MI (0.80%): $142/month (vs. $150 at 618 score)
- Property taxes: $248/month (slightly higher on $217K vs. $215K)
- Insurance: $110/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $1,848 (vs. $1,946 at 618 score)

**Monthly savings:** $1,946 - $1,848 = **$98/month saved**

### Five-Year Cost Comparison: 618 Score vs. 660 Score

**Option 1: Buy at 618 score (7.25% rate)**
- Total payments (5 years): $116,760
- Closing costs: $12,725
- Total invested: $129,485
- Equity built: $74,350
- **Net cost:** $55,135

**Option 2: Wait 3 months, buy at 660 score (6.50% rate)**
- Extra rent while waiting: $4,950
- Total payments (5 years): $110,880 (lower due to 6.50% rate)
- Closing costs: $13,100 (higher due to $217K price vs. $215K)
- Total invested: $128,930
- Equity built: $74,700 (slightly higher due to higher purchase price)
- **Net cost:** $54,230

**Net savings by waiting:** $55,135 (buy at 618) - $54,230 (wait for 660) = **$905 saved over 5 years**

**Monthly savings:** $98/month × 60 months = $5,880

**But:**
- Paid $4,950 extra rent while waiting
- Paid $2,150 more for home (price appreciation)
- **Total delay costs:** $7,100

**True savings:** $5,880 payment savings - $7,100 delay costs = **-$1,220** (buying at 618 was actually $1,220 cheaper)

## What I Learned: The Break-Even Analysis

### When Buying at 618 Makes Sense

✅ **Rent is increasing** (my rent went up 10%—$1,450 to $1,595)  
✅ **You have compensating factors** (stable employment, reserves, low DTI)  
✅ **Home prices are rising fast** (0.5-1% per month in your market)  
✅ **You're paying high rent** ($1,400+/month)  
✅ **You plan to refinance in 2-3 years** (once you improve credit and build equity)

**In my case:** Buying at 618 saved me $1,220 over 5 years compared to waiting 3 months for 660 credit—because rent increases + home appreciation outweighed the higher interest rate.

### When Waiting to Improve Credit Makes Sense

✅ **Rent is stable** (lease locked in for 12+ months at current rate)  
✅ **You're close to 640 or 660** (10-20 point improvement in 1-2 months)  
✅ **Home prices are stable or declining** (no urgency to buy)  
✅ **You're paying low rent** (under $1,200/month)  
✅ **You can improve score quickly** (high credit utilization to pay down, errors to dispute)

**Example:** If my rent was $1,200/month (not increasing), waiting 3 months would've saved me $2,055 over 5 years (lower rate savings minus delay costs).

### The Credit Score Sweet Spots

**580-619:** 10% down required—very expensive. Improve to 620+ to access 3.5% down.

**620-639:** Some lenders accept 3.5% down, but rates are 0.50-0.75% higher. If you can improve to 640+ in 2-3 months, wait.

**640-659:** Standard 3.5% down, moderate rates. If you can improve to 660+ in 1-2 months, consider waiting.

**660-679:** Good rates (within 0.25% of 680+ tier). Marginal benefit to improving further.

**680+:** Best FHA rates (within 0.125% of conventional). No need to wait unless you can quickly hit 700+ for conventional eligibility.

**My 618 score was in the worst tier** (just below 620 cutoff for standard 3.5% down)—but my compensating factors got me approved.

## My Refinance Plan: Eliminating the Higher Rate

**Current situation (1 year later):**
- Credit score: 667 (improved from 618—paid down cards, disputed error, authorized user reported)
- Home value: $228,000 (6% appreciation in 12 months)
- Loan balance: $206,500 (paid down $4,606 in Year 1)
- Equity: $21,500 (9.4%)

**Refinance goal:** Once I hit 20% equity (3-4 more years), refinance to conventional at 620+ credit to eliminate mortgage insurance and reduce rate.

**Projected refinance timeline:** 2027 (3 years from purchase)

**Expected refinance scenario:**
- Home value: $250,000 (projected 16% appreciation by 2027)
- Loan balance: $195,000 (paid down $16,106 over 3 years)
- Equity: $55,000 (22%)
- New conventional loan at 700+ credit: 6.00% rate, no mortgage insurance
- Monthly payment: $1,169 P&I + $0 MI + $260 taxes + $115 insurance = **$1,544/month**
- Current FHA payment: $1,946/month
- **Monthly savings after refinance:** $402/month = $4,824/year

**Total cost of my 618 FHA decision:**
- Years 1-3: Pay higher rate (7.25%) and higher MI = $3,780 extra vs. 660 score
- Years 4-30: Refinance to conventional, eliminate MI, reduce rate = save $402/month

**Net result:** My 618 FHA loan costs me $3,780 extra in first 3 years, but I entered homeownership 3 months earlier, avoided rent increases, and locked in $215,000 purchase price instead of $217,000+.

## The Bottom Line: Should You Buy Now or Improve Credit First?

**I bought at 618 credit score and paid $3,780 extra** in interest over 5 years compared to waiting for 660.

**But accounting for rent increases and home appreciation, buying at 618 was $1,220 cheaper** than waiting 3 months.

**My advice:**

### Buy Now at Lower Credit Score If:

✅ Rent is $1,400+/month and increasing  
✅ Home prices rising 0.5%+ per month in your market  
✅ You have compensating factors (reserves, stable employment, low DTI)  
✅ You're comfortable refinancing in 2-4 years to lower rate and eliminate MI

### Wait to Improve Credit If:

✅ Rent is stable and affordable (under $1,200/month, lease locked in)  
✅ Home prices stable or declining  
✅ You can improve 20-40 points in 2-3 months (high utilization to pay down, errors to dispute)  
✅ You're close to a tier cutoff (615→620, 635→640, 655→660)
