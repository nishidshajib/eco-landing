When I started shopping for a mortgage in February 2024, I assumed **FHA was always better for first-time buyers.**

**What I'd heard:** "FHA has low down payments, flexible qualification, and easier approval than conventional."

**What I didn't know:** Conventional loans can sometimes be cheaper—even for buyers with limited savings.

**My situation:**
- Credit score: 662 (middle score from 655, 662, 670)
- Savings: $26,000 (enough for 3.5% FHA OR 10% conventional)
- Home price: $225,000
- Income: $60,000/year ($5,000/month gross)
- Debts: $520/month (car $395, credit cards $125)

**I applied for BOTH FHA and conventional to compare:**

**FHA loan (3.5% down):**
- Down payment: $7,875
- Rate: 6.75%
- Monthly payment: $1,628 (P&I $1,459 + MI $169)
- Cash at closing: $12,675 (down payment + closing costs)

**Conventional loan (10% down):**
- Down payment: $22,500
- Rate: 6.50%
- Monthly payment: $1,365 (P&I $1,280 + PMI $85)
- Cash at closing: $27,300 (down payment + closing costs)

**Monthly savings with conventional:** $263/month

**BUT:** Conventional required $14,625 MORE cash upfront ($27,300 vs. $12,675).

**Break-even:** $14,625 ÷ $263/month = **56 months** (4.6 years to recoup upfront cost difference)

**My decision:** FHA (because I didn't want to drain my savings completely—I'd have only $11,300 left after conventional closing vs. $13,325 after FHA closing).

Here's my full rate-shopping experience—what I learned comparing FHA vs. conventional, when each loan type wins, and the break-even analysis that determines which saves more money.

## My Rate Shopping Process: Applying for Both FHA and Conventional

### Why I Applied for Both

**My assumption before shopping:** "I'll do FHA because I'm a first-time buyer with 662 credit—conventional is for people with 740+ credit and 20% down."

**What my loan officer told me:** "You might qualify for conventional at 5-10% down with 662 credit. Let me run both options—sometimes conventional is cheaper even with lower down payment."

**I was skeptical—but applied for both.**

**Applications submitted:**
- FHA lender #1: Guaranteed Rate
- FHA lender #2: Rocket Mortgage
- Conventional lender #1: Better.com
- Conventional lender #2: Local credit union

**Total lenders contacted:** 4 (2 FHA, 2 conventional)

**Time invested:** 6 hours over 3 days (filling out applications, submitting docs)

### The Side-by-Side Comparison

| Loan Type | Down Payment | Rate | Monthly Payment | Cash at Closing |
|-----------|--------------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| FHA | $7,875 (3.5%) | 6.75% | $1,628 | $12,675 |
| Conventional | $11,250 (5%) | 6.625% | $1,506 | $15,800 |
| Conventional | $22,500 (10%) | 6.50% | $1,364 | $27,300 |

**Monthly savings vs. FHA:**
- 5% down conventional: $122/month less
- 10% down conventional: $264/month less

**Extra cash required vs. FHA:**
- 5% down conventional: $3,125 more
- 10% down conventional: $14,625 more

**My gut reaction:** "Conventional at 10% down saves me $264/month—that's huge! But $14,625 more upfront is a lot..."

**I needed to run the break-even analysis.**

## Break-Even Analysis: FHA vs. Conventional 10% Down

### The Math

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Monthly payment: $1,628
- Cash at closing: $12,675
- Cash remaining after closing: $26,000 - $12,675 = **$13,325**

**Conventional (10% down):**
- Monthly payment: $1,364
- Cash at closing: $27,300
- Cash remaining after closing: $26,000 - $27,300 = **-$1,300** (I'm $1,300 SHORT!)

**Problem:** I only had $26,000 saved—not enough for conventional 10% down + closing costs ($27,300).

**Options to make conventional work:**
1. Borrow $1,300 from parents (gift funds—allowed by conventional)
2. Use 5% down conventional instead ($15,800 at closing—I'd have $10,200 left)
3. Wait 2 months to save another $2,000 ($1,000/month savings rate)

**What I chose:** I considered 5% down conventional vs. FHA.

### FHA vs. Conventional 5% Down Comparison

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Monthly payment: $1,628
- Cash at closing: $12,675
- Cash remaining: $13,325

**Conventional (5% down):**
- Monthly payment: $1,506
- Cash at closing: $15,800
- Cash remaining: $10,200

**Monthly savings with 5% conventional:** $122/month

**Extra cash required:** $3,125

**Break-even:** $3,125 ÷ $122 = **26 months** (2.2 years)

**After 2.2 years, I'd break even on the extra upfront cost—then save $122/month forever.**

**But:** I'd have $3,125 LESS in reserves ($10,200 vs. $13,325)—less cushion for emergencies.

### My Decision: FHA 3.5% Down

**Why I chose FHA despite higher monthly payment:**

**Reason #1: Preserved cash reserves**
- FHA left me $13,325 after closing
- Conventional 5% would've left me $10,200 (24% less)
- I wanted 6 months expenses in reserves ($9,000)—FHA gave me more breathing room

**Reason #2: Faster path to refinance**
- FHA 3.5% down = starting at 96.5% LTV (loan-to-value)
- Conventional 5% down = starting at 95% LTV
- Both would hit 20% equity (80% LTV) in similar timeframe (4-5 years)
- Once I hit 20% equity, I'd refinance to conventional anyway and eliminate MI/PMI

**Reason #3: Slightly lower closing costs**
- FHA closing costs: $4,800
- Conventional closing costs: $4,550 (only $250 less—not significant)

**Reason #4: Peace of mind**
- Having $13,325 after closing vs. $10,200 reduced my stress
- If I had unexpected expenses (car repair, medical bills), I had cushion
- I didn't want to feel "house-poor" immediately after buying

**Conventional would've saved me $122/month—but I'd have felt financially stretched.**

**FHA cost me $122/month more—but I felt comfortable with my cash position.**

**For me, FHA was the right choice.**

## When FHA Beats Conventional (My Scenarios)

### Scenario 1: You Have Limited Savings (Under $15,000)

**Example:** You have $12,000 saved, buying a $200,000 home.

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Down payment: $7,000
- Closing costs: $4,500
- Total needed: $11,500
- **You qualify—have $500 left for reserves**

**Conventional (5% down):**
- Down payment: $10,000
- Closing costs: $4,300
- Total needed: $14,300
- **You're $2,300 short**

**Conventional (10% down):**
- Down payment: $20,000
- Closing costs: $4,500
- Total needed: $24,500
- **You're $12,500 short**

**FHA wins—it's the only option you can afford.**

### Scenario 2: You Have Low-to-Mid Credit (620-679)

**Example:** 645 credit score, $225,000 home, 5% down.

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Rate: 6.75%
- MI: 0.80% ($150/month)
- Monthly payment: $1,628

**Conventional (5% down):**
- Rate: 6.875% (0.125% higher than FHA for 645 credit)
- PMI: 1.00% ($188/month—higher PMI for lower credit)
- Monthly payment: $1,670

**FHA payment: $1,628**  
**Conventional payment: $1,670**

**FHA wins—saves $42/month** ($15,120 over 30 years)

**Why:** Conventional charges higher PMI rates for credit scores under 680 (0.90-1.20% PMI vs. FHA's flat 0.80% MI regardless of credit score).

### Scenario 3: You Plan to Refinance in 3-5 Years

**Example:** You're buying now with the goal of refinancing once you hit 20% equity.

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Monthly payment: $1,628
- Path to 20% equity: 4-5 years (principal paydown + appreciation)
- Refinance to conventional: Eliminate $150/month MI, reduce rate

**Conventional (5% down):**
- Monthly payment: $1,506
- Path to 20% equity: 4-5 years (similar timeline)
- PMI automatically drops at 22% equity (no refinance needed—but you might refinance for lower rate anyway)

**FHA wins if:**
- You don't want to drain savings (preserve $3,000-$5,000 extra cash)
- You're comfortable paying $122/month more for 4-5 years ($7,320 total extra cost)
- You value the flexibility of lower upfront cost

**Conventional wins if:**
- You have ample savings (can afford 5-10% down without feeling stretched)
- You want to save $122/month NOW (not wait 4-5 years for refinance)
- PMI drops automatically at 22% equity (easier than FHA refinance requirement)

**For me, FHA won—I wanted to preserve cash reserves.**

### Scenario 4: You Have High DTI (Over 40%)

**Example:** 44% DTI, buying with FHA vs. conventional.

**FHA:**
- Standard DTI limit: 43%
- With compensating factors: Up to 50%
- Your 44% DTI: Approved with reserves + stable employment

**Conventional:**
- Standard DTI limit: 43%
- With high credit (740+) + reserves: Up to 45%
- With automated underwriting: Up to 50% (rare)
- Your 44% DTI: Requires excellent credit (740+) or automated approval—harder to qualify

**FHA wins—easier to qualify at 44% DTI with compensating factors.**

## When Conventional Beats FHA (The Counter-Scenarios)

### Scenario 1: You Have Excellent Credit (700+)

**Example:** 720 credit score, $225,000 home, 5% down.

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Rate: 6.75%
- MI: 0.75% ($141/month—FHA MI slightly lower at 720+ credit)
- Monthly payment: $1,619

**Conventional (5% down):**
- Rate: 6.375% (0.375% lower than FHA for 720 credit)
- PMI: 0.40% ($75/month—significantly lower PMI for 720+ credit)
- Monthly payment: $1,417

**FHA payment: $1,619**  
**Conventional payment: $1,417**

**Conventional wins—saves $202/month** ($72,720 over 30 years)

**Why:** Conventional offers much better rates (0.25-0.50% lower) and much lower PMI (0.30-0.50% vs. FHA's 0.75-0.80%) for borrowers with 700+ credit.

### Scenario 2: You Have 10-15% Down Saved

**Example:** $30,000 saved, buying $225,000 home.

**FHA (3.5% down):**
- Down payment: $7,875
- Monthly payment: $1,628
- Cash remaining: $30,000 - $12,675 = $17,325

**Conventional (10% down):**
- Down payment: $22,500
- Monthly payment: $1,364
- Cash remaining: $30,000 - $27,300 = $2,700

**Conventional (15% down):**
- Down payment: $33,750
- Monthly payment: $1,278 (P&I $1,208 + PMI $70)
- Cash remaining: -$3,750 (you're short—need to save $4,000 more)

**If you have exactly $30,000:**
- FHA leaves you $17,325 (better reserves)
- Conventional 10% down leaves you $2,700 (tight reserves)

**If you have $35,000+:**
- Conventional 10% down saves $264/month
- Extra $14,625 upfront pays back in 56 months (4.6 years)
- After 4.6 years, you're saving $31,680 over remaining 25.4 years

**Conventional wins if you have ample savings (don't need to preserve cash).**

### Scenario 3: You Want PMI Removed Automatically (Not Refinance)

**Example:** You plan to stay in the home 7+ years.

**FHA:**
- MI lasts for life of loan (3.5% down = 30 years of MI)
- Only way to remove: Refinance to conventional at 20% equity (costs $4,000-$6,000)

**Conventional:**
- PMI automatically drops at 22% equity (typically 5-7 years)
- No refinance needed—lender removes PMI automatically when you hit 22% LTV

**Conventional wins—PMI removal is automatic and free** (FHA requires refinancing, which costs $4,000-$6,000).

**If you hit 20% equity in Year 5:**
- FHA: Pay $141/month MI for Years 1-5 ($8,460) + refinance cost $5,000 = **$13,460 total MI cost**
- Conventional: Pay $75/month PMI for Years 1-5 ($4,500) + $0 to remove = **$4,500 total PMI cost**

**Conventional saves $8,960** (by avoiding FHA refinance requirement).

### Scenario 4: You're Buying a High-Value Home ($400,000+)

**Example:** $450,000 home.

**FHA:**
- Down payment (3.5%): $15,750
- Loan amount: $434,250
- Upfront MI: $7,599 (financed)
- Annual MI: 0.80% = $295/month
- **Total monthly MI:** $295

**Conventional:**
- Down payment (10%): $45,000
- Loan amount: $405,000
- PMI (0.50%): $169/month
- **Total monthly PMI:** $169

**Monthly savings with conventional:** $126/month ($45,360 over 30 years)

**But:** Conventional requires $29,250 more upfront ($45,000 down + closing vs. $15,750 down + closing)

**Break-even:** $29,250 ÷ $126 = 232 months (19.3 years—very long!)

**Conventional wins if:**
- You have $50,000+ saved (can afford 10% down without draining savings)
- You plan to stay 15+ years (long enough to break even)

**FHA wins if:**
- You only have $20,000-$25,000 saved (can't afford 10% down)
- You plan to refinance in 5 years anyway (break-even doesn't matter)

## My Personal Break-Even Timeline: FHA vs. Conventional

### If I'd Done Conventional 10% Down Instead of FHA

**Extra cash upfront:** $14,625 ($27,300 conventional - $12,675 FHA)

**Monthly savings:** $264/month ($1,628 FHA - $1,364 conventional)

**Break-even:** $14,625 ÷ $264 = **55 months** (4 years 7 months)

**Year-by-year comparison:**

**Year 1:**
- FHA total cost: $1,628 × 12 = $19,536 + $12,675 closing = $32,211
- Conventional total cost: $1,364 × 12 = $16,368 + $27,300 closing = $43,668
- **FHA cheaper by $11,457**

**Year 2:**
- FHA total cost: $32,211 + $19,536 = $51,747
- Conventional total cost: $43,668 + $16,368 = $60,036
- **FHA cheaper by $8,289**

**Year 3:**
- FHA total cost: $51,747 + $19,536 = $71,283
- Conventional total cost: $60,036 + $16,368 = $76,404
- **FHA cheaper by $5,121**

**Year 4:**
- FHA total cost: $71,283 + $19,536 = $90,819
- Conventional total cost: $76,404 + $16,368 = $92,772
- **FHA cheaper by $1,953**

**Year 5:**
- FHA total cost: $90,819 + $19,536 = $110,355
- Conventional total cost: $92,772 + $16,368 = $109,140
- **Conventional cheaper by $1,215** (break-even crossed in Year 5!)

**After Year 5, conventional saves $264/month forever** ($79,200 over remaining 25 years).

**But:** I'd have only $11,375 left in savings after conventional closing (vs. $13,325 after FHA)—a tighter cash position for 4+ years.

**For me, FHA was the right choice in Years 1-4—I valued the extra $2,000 in reserves more than saving $264/month.**

## How I'm Planning to Refinance Out of FHA (Year 4-5)

### My Refinance Target: 2027-2028 (4-5 Years from Purchase)

**Current situation (2024):**
- Home value: $225,000
- Loan balance: $220,925 (original $217,125 + $3,800 upfront MI)
- FHA rate: 6.75%
- FHA MI: $175/month
- Monthly payment: $1,628

**Projected situation (2027—Year 3):**
- Home value: $245,000 (3% annual appreciation)
- Loan balance: $204,500 (paid down $16,425 over 3 years)
- Equity: $40,500 (16.5%—not quite 20% yet)

**Projected situation (2028—Year 4):**
- Home value: $252,350
- Loan balance: $198,800
- Equity: $53,550 (21.2%—over 20%!)

**My refinance plan (2028):**
- Refinance to conventional at 20%+ equity (no PMI)
- Improve credit from 662 to 700+ (by paying cards, aging accounts)
- Target rate: 5.75-6.00% (assuming rates drop 0.75-1.00% by 2028)
- New monthly payment: $1,320 (P&I $1,160 + taxes $230 + insurance $95 + $0 MI/PMI)
- Monthly savings: $308/month ($1,628 FHA - $1,320 conventional)

**Refinance costs:** $5,000 (appraisal, title, lender fees)

**Break-even on refinance:** $5,000 ÷ $308 = **16 months** (payback refinance costs in 1.3 years)

**After 16 months, I'm saving $308/month in pure profit** ($92,400 over remaining 24.7 years).

**Why waiting 4 years to refinance is worth it:**
- FHA got me into the home NOW (vs. waiting to save 10% down for conventional)
- I built $53,550 equity over 4 years (vs. $0 if I'd kept renting)
- I can refinance to conventional at 20% equity and save $308/month for life of loan

**FHA was my bridge to homeownership—conventional will be my long-term loan.**

## The Bottom Line: FHA vs. Conventional Isn't One-Size-Fits-All

**I rate-shopped both FHA and conventional:**
- FHA: $1,628/month, $12,675 at closing, $13,325 reserves left
- Conventional 10%: $1,364/month, $27,300 at closing, -$1,300 (short on cash!)

**I chose FHA because:**
- I only had $26,000 saved (not enough for conventional 10% down comfortably)
- FHA left me $13,325 in reserves (vs. being $1,300 short with conventional)
- I plan to refinance in 4-5 years anyway (once I hit 20% equity + improve credit to 700+)

**Conventional would've been better if:**
- I'd had $35,000+ saved (enough for 10% down + $7,700 reserves)
- I'd had 700+ credit (better conventional rates + lower PMI)
- I'd wanted PMI to drop automatically (vs. refinancing FHA MI)

**My advice:**

### Choose FHA If:

✅ **You have limited savings** (under $15,000)  
✅ **Your credit is 620-679** (FHA MI cheaper than conventional PMI at this credit range)  
✅ **Your DTI is 44-50%** (FHA more flexible than conventional)  
✅ **You plan to refinance in 3-5 years** (FHA gets you in NOW, conventional later)

### Choose Conventional If:

✅ **You have 10-20% down saved** (enough to avoid feeling cash-poor)  
✅ **Your credit is 700+** (much better conventional rates + lower PMI)  
✅ **You want PMI removed automatically** (drops at 22% equity—no refinance needed)  
✅ **You're buying high-value home** ($400,000+—FHA MI more expensive at higher loan amounts)

### Rate Shop BOTH

✅ **Don't assume FHA is always cheaper** (conventional can be better for 700+ credit)  
✅ **Don't assume conventional is always cheaper** (FHA can be better for 620-679 credit)  
✅ **Apply to 2-3 FHA lenders + 2-3 conventional lenders** (rates vary 0.25-0.50%)  
✅ **Run break-even analysis** (calculate how long to recoup extra upfront cost)
