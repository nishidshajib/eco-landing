## What Is a Portfolio Lender?

A portfolio lender keeps loans in-house rather than selling them to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This allows manual underwriting and flexibility on DTI, income documentation, and property type—critical in New Jersey where property taxes and jumbo pricing create unique hurdles.

## When NJ Borrowers Need Portfolio Lending

### 1) Jumbo Loans Above $806,550
NJ’s conforming loan limit is $806,550. Any loan above that requires jumbo financing. Portfolio lenders often provide better approval odds for high-balance loans.

### 2) High DTI from Property Taxes
NJ property taxes average 2.49%. A $1M home adds ~$2,083/month in taxes, compressing DTI. Portfolio lenders allow 45%–50% DTI versus 43% agency caps.

### 3) Self-Employed or Complex Income
Portfolio lenders can use bank statements, K-1s, or asset-based underwriting instead of strict W-2 income documentation.

### 4) Unique Properties
Condos, mixed-use buildings, or estate properties often require flexible underwriting.

## Portfolio vs Agency: A Quick Comparison

**Agency Lenders:**
- DTI cap 43%
- Strict income documentation
- Best rates for 740+ credit
- Limited flexibility on property type

**Portfolio Lenders:**
- DTI flexibility 45%–50%
- Bank statement and asset-based options
- Slight rate premium (0.25%–0.75%)
- Better approval odds for complex profiles

## County-Specific Portfolio Needs

**Bergen:** Jumbo purchases, strong portfolio competition
**Essex:** Luxury properties and complex income
**Morris:** Estate properties and acreage
**Hudson:** Condos with HOA complexity

## How to Choose a Portfolio Lender

Ask these questions:
- What is your maximum DTI?
- Do you accept bank statement or asset-based underwriting?
- Do you lend on condos in my building?
- How many NJ portfolio loans have you closed this year?
- What rate premium should I expect?

## The Bottom Line

Portfolio lenders are essential for NJ borrowers with jumbo loans, high DTI from property taxes, or complex income. The right lender trades a small rate premium for approval flexibility and faster closing.
