## Arizona HELOC vs Home Equity Loan: Complete Comparison

Arizona homeowners accessing home equity face a key choice: **HELOC (flexible draws, variable rate) vs home equity loan (lump sum, fixed rate).** Understanding the differences helps you choose the product that best matches your financial situation and goals.

### What is a HELOC?

**HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) Definition:**

A HELOC is a flexible revolving line of credit secured by your home's equity. Think of it like a credit card backed by your home equity.

**How HELOC works:**

1. **Approval & credit line established:** Lender reviews home value, mortgage balance, credit score, income. Approves HELOC with maximum borrowing amount (e.g., $75,000).

2. **Draw period (typically 5-10 years):** Access funds as needed by writing checks or transferring to bank account. Pay interest only on amounts borrowed, not entire credit line.

3. **Repayment period (typically 15-20 years):** HELOC converts to amortizing loan. Pay principal + interest monthly. Some HELOCs allow re-borrowing after paying down principal.

**Example: $400K Phoenix Home**

*Setup:*
- Home value: $400,000
- Mortgage balance: $300,000
- Available equity: $100,000
- HELOC approved: $80,000 (at 80% LTV)

*Year 1 (Draw period):*
- Month 1: Draw $10,000 for kitchen renovation
- Monthly payment: $67 (interest-only at 8% rate)
- Month 4: Draw additional $15,000 for bathroom
- Monthly payment: $167 (interest on $25,000 total)
- Month 12: Total drawn: $30,000; monthly payment: $200
- Annual interest paid: ~$1,200 (only on amounts borrowed)

*Year 6 (After draw period ends):*
- Total drawn over 5 years: $50,000
- Monthly payment now: ~$477 (principal + interest over 20-year repayment period)
- Total monthly cost: Increases from interest-only to full amortization

### What is a Home Equity Loan?

**Home Equity Loan Definition:**

A home equity loan is a fixed-rate loan secured by your home's equity. Lender provides single lump sum; you repay over fixed term.

**How home equity loan works:**

1. **Approval & loan amount:** Lender approves specific loan amount based on equity, credit, income. Example: $50,000 loan approved.

2. **Funding:** Entire $50,000 distributed at closing. Single lump sum (no drawing over time).

3. **Repayment:** Fixed monthly payment over fixed term (typically 5-15 years). Payment includes principal + interest; amount never changes.

**Example: Same $400K Phoenix Home**

*Setup:*
- Home equity loan: $50,000
- Fixed rate: 8.5%
- Term: 10 years
- Monthly payment: $607 (fixed for entire 10 years)

*Year 1:*
- Monthly payment: $607 (every month)
- Interest paid: $4,118 in year 1
- Principal paid: $3,156 in year 1

*Year 10:*
- Monthly payment: Still $607 (never changes)
- Interest paid: Minimal (mostly paid early years)
- Principal paid: $7,231 in year 10
- Loan paid off completely

### HELOC Advantages & Disadvantages

**HELOC Advantages:**

✅ **Flexible fund access:** Draw $10K one month, $20K next month as needed. Only pay interest on amounts borrowed.

✅ **Lower initial costs:** Interest-only payments during draw period (5-10 years) keep costs minimal while accessing funds.

✅ **No closing costs:** Most HELOCs have $0-500 closing costs vs $1,000-2,000 for home equity loans.

✅ **Best for variable needs:** Home renovation projects with unknown exact costs benefit from flexible access.

✅ **Emergency fund capability:** Keep open for emergencies; only pay interest if you use it.

**HELOC Disadvantages:**

❌ **Rate uncertainty:** Variable rate tied to Prime (currently 5.25%). If Prime rises, HELOC rate rises; monthly payment increases.

❌ **Payment shock risk:** At end of draw period, payment increases significantly (from interest-only to principal + interest). Example: $200/month → $477/month possible.

❌ **Complexity:** Two periods (draw + repayment) with different payment structures create confusion.

❌ **Rate caps matter:** Most HELOCs have lifetime rate caps (e.g., Prime + 5.75% = 11% maximum). If rates spike, cap limits the damage but still expensive.

---

### Home Equity Loan Advantages & Disadvantages

**Home Equity Loan Advantages:**

✅ **Fixed rate:** Rate locked for entire loan term. Predictable payment; no rate risk.

✅ **Fixed payment:** Same $607/month for entire 10 years (example). Budget certainty.

✅ **No payment shock:** Unlike HELOC, no sudden increase at end of draw period.

✅ **Psychological simplicity:** One payment, one term, clear payoff date.

✅ **Best for known amounts:** If you need exact $50,000 for kitchen renovation, home equity loan perfect.

**Home Equity Loan Disadvantages:**

❌ **Lump sum only:** Can't access additional funds later. If renovation needs increase mid-project, stuck (or need new loan).

❌ **Higher closing costs:** $1,000-2,000 typical vs $0-500 for HELOC.

❌ **Higher rates than HELOC draw:** Since you have full principal upfront, rates typically 0.25-0.50% higher than HELOC rate.

❌ **Less flexibility:** Once approved, you receive entire amount. Can't reduce if circumstances change.

❌ **Immediate repayment obligation:** Start paying principal + interest immediately (vs HELOC interest-only option).

### When to Choose HELOC

**Choose HELOC if:**

1. **Unknown total project cost:** Home renovation with variable scope (might need $30K or $50K)
2. **Phased projects:** Kitchen now, bathroom next year, roof in 2 years
3. **Emergency fund:** Want credit line available for unexpected expenses
4. **Rate comfortable with variable:** Don't mind if Prime rises (can pay down to manage)
5. **Want lowest initial cost:** Interest-only payments during draw period minimize early costs
6. **Low closing cost important:** $0-500 vs $1,000-2,000 for home equity loan

**HELOC use case example:**

**James's Kitchen & Bathroom Renovation (Phoenix):**
- Total equity: $150,000
- HELOC approved: $100,000 at 8% rate
- Year 1: Draws $40,000 for kitchen (pays $267/month interest-only)
- Year 2: Draws $25,000 for bathroom (pays $417/month interest-only)
- Year 3: Draws $15,000 for finishing work (pays $533/month interest-only)
- Year 6: Draw period ends; $80,000 borrowed total
- Years 6-25: Pays $477/month (principal + interest amortized over 20 years)
- **Advantage:** Accessed funds as needed; paid interest-only while drawing; no payment shock because amortization spread over 20 years

---

### When to Choose Home Equity Loan

**Choose home equity loan if:**

1. **Exact known amount:** Roof replacement costs $45,000; need exactly that
2. **Immediate use:** Debt consolidation; need entire amount now
3. **Rate certainty critical:** Can't tolerate variable rates; want fixed forever
4. **Short payoff timeline:** Prefer 5-10 year term vs HELOC's 20-year repayment
5. **Simpler loan structure:** Don't want two periods (draw + repay)
6. **Budget predictability:** Must know exact payment for financial planning

**Home equity loan use case example:**

**Maria's Debt Consolidation (Chandler):**
- Credit cards: $45,000 at 18% APR = $675/month
- Home equity loan: $45,000 at 8.5% for 10 years = $478/month
- **Advantage:** Exact amount needed; fixed rate; payment predictable; $197/month savings ($23,640 over 10 years)
- **Drawback:** Can't access additional funds if needed

*Years 1-5 (Draw & Interest-Only):*
- Draw $50,000 over first year
- Payment year 1-5: $333/month (interest-only)
- Total paid years 1-5: $19,980

*Years 6-20 (Repayment):*
- Payment years 6-20: $477/month (principal + interest, 15-year amortization)
- Total paid years 6-20: $85,860

*Total cost HELOC:* $19,980 + $85,860 = **$105,840** (over 20 years)

**Cost Comparison:**

| Period | HELOC (8.0%) | Home Equity Loan (8.5%) |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Years 1-5** | $19,980 | $30,350 |
| **Years 6-10** | $28,620 | $30,350 |
| **Years 11-20** | $57,240 | $0 |
| **Total (20 yrs)** | $105,840 | $72,840 |
| **Difference** | — | **HELOC costs $33,000 more** |

**Key insight:** Even though HELOC rate lower during draw, 20-year total cost higher because of extended repayment period (20 years vs 10 years).
