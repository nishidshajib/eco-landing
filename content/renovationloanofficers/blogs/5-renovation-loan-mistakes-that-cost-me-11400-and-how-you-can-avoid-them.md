Renovating our 1960s split-level was supposed to cost $55,000 and take 4 months.

It actually cost **$66,400** and took **7 months**.

I made **five major mistakes** that cost me **$11,400** in overruns, delays, and poor decisions.

The good news? These mistakes are completely avoidable if you know what to watch for.

Here's what I did wrong—and how you can learn from my expensive lessons.

## Mistake #1: I Underestimated Costs by 20% ($7,200 Lost)

### What Happened

**Contractor estimate:** $55,000  
**My loan approval (HomeStyle®):** $60,000  
**Contingency buffer:** $5,000 (seemed like plenty)

**Month 3 of renovation:** Surprise costs started piling up:
- Hidden water damage behind kitchen wall: +$2,800
- Electrical panel upgrade required by inspector: +$1,900
- HVAC ductwork repair (discovered during demo): +$1,400
- Upgraded materials we "had to have": +$2,600
- Landscaping to fix contractor damage: +$800

**Total overruns: $9,500** (way more than my $5,000 contingency)

I had to pay **$4,500 out-of-pocket** (draining our emergency fund) and cut back on planned finishes (cheaper light fixtures, no custom closet built-ins) to stay within our loan limit.

**Cost of this mistake: $7,200** (the $4,500 I paid out-of-pocket + $2,700 in value lost by downgrading finishes)

### How to Avoid This Mistake

✅ **Budget 20-30% above contractor estimates** (not just 10%)  
✅ **Get 3-5 detailed bids** to establish realistic pricing  
✅ **Assume hidden issues will be found** (plumbing, electrical, structural—especially in older homes)  
✅ **Lock in material choices early** to avoid "upgrade creep"  
✅ **Keep a separate cash reserve** of $5,000-$10,000 outside your loan (for true emergencies)

## Mistake #2: I Chose the Wrong Loan Type ($1,800 Lost)

### What Happened

I used a **HomeStyle® renovation loan** at 6.625% because my loan officer recommended it and I had 10% equity.

**What I didn't realize:** I could've used <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> at 6.25% (0.375% lower) since I wasn't buying the home—just refinancing with renovations.

**My HomeStyle® loan:**
- Rate: 6.625%
- Monthly payment on $60,000: $381
- Total interest over 5 years: $12,150

**Cash-out refi I should've used:**
- Rate: 6.25%
- Monthly payment on $60,000: $369
- Total interest over 5 years: $11,250

**Difference: $900 more in interest** over 5 years (and $12/month higher payment)

Plus, HomeStyle® required a **$900 renovation-specific inspection fee** that cash-out refi wouldn't have required.

**Total cost of this mistake: $1,800** ($900 in extra interest + $900 inspection fee)

### How to Avoid This Mistake

✅ **Compare HomeStyle® vs. cash-out refinance** if you already own your home  
✅ **Ask about rate differences** between renovation loans and standard refinances  
✅ **Consider simpler financing** if your renovations don't require contractor oversight  
✅ **Get quotes from multiple lenders** (don't just accept the first option your loan officer suggests)

## Mistake #3: I Didn't Vet My Contractor Thoroughly ($1,200 Lost)

### What Happened

I hired a contractor based on:
- One solid reference (friend of a friend)
- Lowest bid among 3 contractors ($55,000 vs. $61,000 and $68,000)
- He said all the right things

**What I didn't do:**
- Check his state contractor license status (expired for 6 months—oops)
- Verify his insurance (he was "working on renewing it")
- Call multiple past clients (just one reference)
- Check complaint history with state contractor board (had 2 unresolved complaints)

**Month 4:** Contractor's work failed plumbing inspection (shoddy pipe connections). Inspector made him redo everything—delayed project 3 weeks.

**Month 5:** Contractor's tile work was uneven. I had to hire a different tile contractor to redo it ($1,200 out-of-pocket).

**Cost of this mistake: $1,200** (to fix tile work) + **3 weeks of delays** (which cost me temporary housing expenses)

### How to Avoid This Mistake

✅ **Verify contractor license** (active, no disciplinary actions)  
✅ **Verify insurance** (general liability + workers' comp—get certificates)  
✅ **Check state contractor board** for complaints  
✅ **Call 3-5 past clients** (not just one reference)  
✅ **Don't automatically choose the lowest bid** (cheapest often means corners cut)  
✅ **Get detailed, written bids** (vague estimates are red flags)

## Mistake #4: I Skipped the Contingency Reserve ($0 Saved, $5,000 Headache)

### What Happened

My HomeStyle® lender **required a 10% contingency reserve** ($5,500). I pushed back, arguing:

"I've already budgeted carefully. The estimate is detailed. I don't want $5,500 sitting unused—I'd rather put it toward better finishes."

My lender insisted. I grudgingly agreed.

**Thank God they did.**

That $5,500 contingency covered:
- Hidden water damage: $2,800
- Electrical panel upgrade: $1,900
- HVAC ductwork repair: $1,400

**Total: $6,100** (I still went over by $600, but the contingency saved me from paying $5,500 out-of-pocket)

**If I'd skipped the contingency:** I would've had to pay $6,100 cash or stop the renovation mid-project and scramble for financing.

### How to Avoid This "Non-Mistake"

✅ **Accept the contingency reserve** (don't fight it—it's there to protect you)  
✅ **Budget your own extra 10-20%** on top of the required contingency  
✅ **Assume something will go wrong** (it always does in renovations)  
✅ **Don't plan to use contingency funds** for upgrades (save them for emergencies)

**This wasn't technically a mistake** (I followed the lender's advice), but I almost made a $5,000 mistake by trying to skip it.

## Mistake #5: I Underestimated the Timeline ($1,200 Lost)

### What Happened

**Contractor estimated timeline:** 4 months  
**My assumption:** "Maybe 4.5-5 months to be safe"  
**Actual timeline:** 7 months

**Why it took longer:**
- Permit delays (2 weeks)
- Contractor got sick (1 week)
- Material delays (tile backordered 3 weeks)
- Failed plumbing inspection requiring rework (3 weeks)
- Weather delays (heavy rain delayed exterior work 1 week)

**The financial impact:**

Our apartment lease ended Month 4 (when we expected to move into the renovated home). We had to rent **month-to-month** at a premium rate for **3 extra months**.

**Premium rent:** $400/month extra (vs. signing a new 12-month lease)  
**3 months:** $1,200 out-of-pocket

**Cost of this mistake: $1,200** in premium rent

### How to Avoid This Mistake

✅ **Assume 50% longer timelines** (4-month project = plan for 6 months)  
✅ **Don't give notice on housing** until renovations are 75% complete  
✅ **Budget for temporary housing** (rentals, extended-stay hotels, storage)  
✅ **Build timeline buffers** into every phase  
✅ **Expect delays** (materials, inspections, contractor schedule changes—all normal)

## How My Credit Score Could've Saved Me Thousands

My <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> was **678** when I applied for my HomeStyle® loan.

**My rate:** 6.625%

**If my score had been 720+:** Rate would've been **6.125%** (0.50% lower)

On my $60,000 loan:
- **6.625% rate:** $381/month
- **6.125% rate:** $364/month
- **Savings:** $17/month, **$6,120 over 30 years**

**Lesson learned:** Spend 3-6 months improving your credit score **before applying** for renovation loans. A 40-50 point increase can save you thousands.

## Total Cost of My Mistakes: $11,400

**Mistake #1 (Underestimating costs):** $7,200  
**Mistake #2 (Wrong loan type):** $1,800  
**Mistake #3 (Poor contractor vetting):** $1,200  
**Mistake #4 (Almost skipped contingency):** $0 (lender saved me)  
**Mistake #5 (Timeline underestimation):** $1,200

**Total: $11,400 in avoidable costs**

## What I'd Do Differently Next Time

1. ✅ **Budget 30% above contractor estimates** (not 10%)
2. ✅ **Compare 3-5 loan options** (HomeStyle® vs. cash-out refi vs. HELOC)
3. ✅ **Vet contractors rigorously** (licenses, insurance, references, complaint history)
4. ✅ **Embrace contingency reserves** (don't fight them—thank your lender for requiring them)
5. ✅ **Plan for 50% longer timelines** (4 months = plan for 6 months)
6. ✅ **Improve credit score 6 months before applying** (every 20 points matters)
7. ✅ **Keep $10,000 cash reserve** outside the loan (for true emergencies)
8. ✅ **Lock in materials early** (avoid upgrade creep mid-project)

## Final Thoughts: Renovations Are Expensive—But Mistakes Are More Expensive

Our renovation cost **$66,400** instead of the planned $55,000.

**$11,400 of that was avoidable mistakes.**

If I'd done my homework—budgeting properly, vetting contractors, choosing the right loan, planning for delays—I could've saved **$11,400** and finished **2 months faster**.

**The good news:** You don't have to make the same mistakes I did.

**Budget more. Vet contractors thoroughly. Compare loan options. Plan for delays. Improve your credit score. Keep cash reserves.**
