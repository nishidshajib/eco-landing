**Renovation loan officers** specialize in financing home improvements through FHA 203(k) rehab loans, Fannie Mae HomeStyle® renovation financing, and cash-out refinance options. They coordinate contractor bids, structure draw schedules, and help you maximize ROI on kitchen remodels, bathroom upgrades, additions, and major repairs.

Renovation financing is more complex than traditional mortgages. These specialists help you compare FHA 203(k) (for fixer-uppers with 3.5% down) versus HomeStyle® (for luxury renovations and investment properties) versus cash-out refinance (for tapping existing equity), navigate contractor requirements, and plan after-repair value appraisals.
