Connecticut mortgage rates follow national market trends, but **local seasonality** creates timing advantages for borrowers who compare lenders strategically.

## National vs Local Drivers

### National Drivers

- Federal Reserve policy
- 10-year Treasury yields
- Mortgage-backed securities market

### Local Drivers

- Spring/Summer buying season (more lender competition)
- Fall/Winter slowdowns (fee negotiation leverage)
- Fairfield County luxury market dynamics

---

## Seasonal Pattern Overview

### Spring (March–May)

- Buyer demand increases
- Lenders tighten pricing slightly
- **Best time to compare multiple offers**

### Summer (June–August)

- Peak competition among lenders
- More negotiation leverage on fees
- Rates often stabilize

### Fall (September–November)

- Buyer demand slows
- Lenders may reduce fees to maintain volume
- Potential small rate dips

### Winter (December–February)

- Slow market overall
- Best time to negotiate lender credits
- National rate trends dominate

---

## Fairfield County Exception

Luxury markets in Fairfield County operate differently:
- High-net-worth buyers are less seasonal
- Jumbo pricing remains competitive year-round
- Rate shopping still critical due to larger fee variance

---

## Lock Strategy for CT Borrowers

### 1) Monitor National Rates

Track 10-year Treasury yields and Fed announcements. National trends outweigh local seasonality.

### 2) Compare 3–5 Lenders

Seasonal competition is strongest in spring/summer. Request Loan Estimates to compare APR.

### 3) Negotiate Fees in Slow Seasons

Fall/winter periods often allow lender credits or reduced origination fees.

## Bottom Line

Connecticut rates follow national trends, but local lender competition creates **0.125%–0.25% pricing variance** across seasons. Lock when the rate meets your budget and use seasonal leverage to negotiate fees.
