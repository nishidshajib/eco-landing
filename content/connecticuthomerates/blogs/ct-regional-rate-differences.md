Connecticut mortgage rates vary by region due to lender competition, property values, and jumbo loan concentration. Understanding these differences helps borrowers choose the right lender and avoid overpaying.

## Hartford Market

### Characteristics

- Strong lender competition (banks, credit unions, brokers)
- Predominantly conforming loans
- First-time buyer activity high

### Rate Environment

---

## New Haven Market

### Characteristics

- Strong lender presence, similar to Hartford
- Mix of conforming and FHA loans
- University-driven housing demand

### Rate Environment

Rates are competitive, but **APR differences can be larger** due to fee variations across lenders.

## Fairfield County Market (Stamford, Greenwich, Westport)

### Characteristics

- Luxury market pricing patterns
- Specialized jumbo lenders dominate
