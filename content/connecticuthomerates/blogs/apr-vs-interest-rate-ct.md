Connecticut borrowers often focus on the interest rate, but **APR reveals the true cost of borrowing** by including lender fees and points.

## Interest Rate vs APR

### Interest Rate

- Determines monthly principal + interest payment
- Does not include lender fees

### APR

- Includes interest rate + lender fees
- Standardized cost for lender comparison

---

## Connecticut Fee Variance

Lender fees vary widely across Connecticut:

- Local banks: $2,000–$6,000
- Credit unions: $500–$2,000
- Jumbo lenders: $8,000–$25,000

## APR Comparison Example

### $600K Loan (Fairfield County Jumbo)

| Lender | Rate | APR | Fees |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| Lender A | 6.50% | 6.85% | $20,000 |
| Lender B | 6.75% | 6.90% | $10,000 |

**Insight**: Lender B has a higher rate but lower APR because fees are lower.
