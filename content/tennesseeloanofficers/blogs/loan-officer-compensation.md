## Tennessee Loan Officer Compensation: How MLOs Get Paid

Understanding how Tennessee mortgage loan officers are compensated helps borrowers evaluate total loan costs and identify potential conflicts of interest. **MLO compensation models—salary, commission, or hybrid—affect pricing, service quality, and whether borrowers get best available rates.**

### Tennessee Loan Officer Compensation Models

**1. Commission-Based (Most Common)**

**How it works:**
- Loan officer paid percentage of loan amount
- Typical range: 0.50-2.50% of loan amount
- No base salary; 100% performance-based
- Higher loan volume = higher income

**Example: Nashville loan officer, commission-based**

*Compensation structure:*
- 1.00% commission on all closed loans
- Monthly volume: $2 million (10 loans × $200K average)
- Monthly commission: $20,000
- Annual income: $240,000

**Borrower impact:**

*Positive:*
- ✅ Loan officer motivated to close quickly (time = money)
- ✅ Often available evenings/weekends (commission incentive)
- ✅ Responsive communication (protect commission)

*Negative:*
- ❌ May prioritize loan count over best borrower outcome
- ❌ Pressure to close even if marginal deal
- ❌ May recommend higher-fee products (increases commission)

---

**2. Salary + Commission (Hybrid)**

**How it works:**
- Base salary + commission on closed loans
- Typical: $40K-$60K base + 0.25-1.00% commission
- More stability; still performance-incentivized

**Example: Memphis loan officer, hybrid compensation**

*Compensation structure:*
- Base salary: $50,000
- Commission: 0.50% on closed loans
- Monthly volume: $1.5 million (8 loans × $187.5K average)
- Monthly commission: $7,500
- Annual income: $50,000 base + $90,000 commission = $140,000

**Borrower impact:**

*Positive:*
- ✅ Less pressure to close bad deals (base salary provides stability)
- ✅ Can take time with complex scenarios (not 100% commission-dependent)
- ✅ May provide better guidance (less transaction-focused)

*Negative:*
- ❌ Still commission-motivated for volume
- ❌ May not be as responsive as pure commission MLOs (less urgency)

---

**3. Salary-Only (Rare)**

**How it works:**
- Fixed salary regardless of loan volume
- Typical: $50K-$80K annually
- Common at credit unions, some banks

**Example: Knoxville credit union loan officer**

*Compensation structure:*
- Salary: $65,000
- No commission or bonuses
- Volume expectations: 4-6 loans/month minimum

**Borrower impact:**

*Positive:*
- ✅ No financial incentive to steer borrowers to higher-cost products
- ✅ Can recommend best option without commission consideration
- ✅ Less pressure to close marginal deals
- ✅ Often better member education (not sales-focused)

*Negative:*
- ❌ May be less motivated to work evenings/weekends
- ❌ Response times may lag commission-based MLOs
- ❌ Less urgency to close quickly (no commission incentive)

### How Tennessee Loan Officers Are Compensated

**Borrower-Paid Compensation (Origination Fee):**

Borrower pays loan officer/company directly via origination fee.

**Typical Tennessee origination fees:**
- Banks: $0-$2,000 (often waived for existing customers)
- Credit unions: $0-$1,500
- Mortgage companies: $1,500-$3,000
- Mortgage brokers: $1,500-$5,000 (0.50-1.50% of loan amount)

**Example: Chattanooga broker, borrower-paid compensation**

*Loan scenario:*
- Loan amount: $300,000
- Origination fee: 1.00% = $3,000
- Paid by borrower at closing
- Loan officer receives portion (50-100% depending on brokerage split)

**Pros:** Transparent; borrower sees exact fee on Loan Estimate

**Cons:** Increases upfront closing costs

---

**Lender-Paid Compensation (Yield Spread Premium):**

Lender pays loan officer/company from loan proceeds (not borrower).

**How it works:**
- Borrower accepts slightly higher rate (e.g., 6.50% vs 6.375%)
- Lender pays loan officer commission for higher rate (e.g., 1.00% of loan amount)
- Borrower pays less upfront; more interest over time

**Example: Memphis loan, lender-paid compensation**

*Loan scenario:*
- Loan amount: $250,000
- Rate option A: 6.375%, $2,500 origination fee (borrower-paid)
- Rate option B: 6.50%, $0 origination fee (lender-paid)
- Lender pays loan officer $2,500 (1.00%) for higher rate

**Pros:** Lower upfront closing costs; good for cash-strapped borrowers

**Cons:** Higher monthly payment; more interest over loan life

**Total cost comparison (30 years):**

*Option A (6.375%, $2,500 fee):*
- Monthly P&I: $1,557
- Total interest: $310,520
- Upfront cost: $2,500
- **Total cost: $313,020**

*Option B (6.50%, $0 fee):*
- Monthly P&I: $1,580
- Total interest: $318,800
- Upfront cost: $0
- **Total cost: $318,800**

**Difference:** Option B costs $5,780 more over 30 years (worth it if holding <7 years)

---

**Hybrid Compensation:**

Some loans combine borrower-paid and lender-paid compensation.

**Example: Nashville hybrid compensation**

*Loan scenario:*
- Loan amount: $400,000
- Borrower pays: $1,500 origination fee
- Lender pays: $2,000 (0.50% for slightly higher rate)
- Total compensation: $3,500
- Effective rate: 0.875%

---

### Tennessee Loan Officer Compensation Regulations

**Federal Loan Originator Compensation Rule (Dodd-Frank Act):**

**Key provisions:**

**1. No Steering to Higher-Cost Loans**

Loan officers cannot receive higher compensation for steering borrowers to higher-rate or higher-fee loans.

**Example of illegal steering:**
- Borrower qualifies for 6.25% rate
- Loan officer recommends 6.50% rate to earn higher commission
- **Violation:** MLO prioritized compensation over borrower's interest

---

**2. Compensation Must Be Based on Loan Amount Only**

Loan officers can't be paid based on:
- ❌ Interest rate (higher rate = higher commission)
- ❌ Loan terms (ARM vs fixed)
- ❌ Lender selection

Loan officers can be paid based on:
- ✅ Loan amount (percentage of principal)
- ✅ Flat fee per loan

**Example of compliant compensation:**
- All loans: 1.00% commission regardless of rate/terms
- Borrower chooses rate/lender; loan officer paid same either way

**Example of non-compliant compensation:**
- 6.25% rate: 0.75% commission
- 6.50% rate: 1.25% commission
- **Violation:** Rate-based compensation incentivizes steering

---

**3. No Dual Compensation**

If borrower pays origination fee, lender cannot also pay loan officer commission (and vice versa).

**Compliant:**
- Borrower pays $3,000 origination fee; lender pays $0
- OR Borrower pays $0; lender pays $3,000 (via higher rate)

**Non-compliant:**
- Borrower pays $2,000 + lender pays $1,500 = dual compensation
- **Violation:** Double-dipping banned

---

**4. Disclosure Requirements**

Loan officers must disclose compensation on Loan Estimate:
- Section A: Origination charges (borrower-paid)
- If lender-paid: Disclosed in rate comparison section

**Borrower rights:**
- View exact compensation
- Compare multiple Loan Estimates
- Request breakdown of how MLO is paid

---

### How Tennessee Borrowers Can Evaluate Loan Officer Compensation

**Step 1: Review Loan Estimate (Section A)**

**Origination charges include:**
- Loan officer fee or origination fee (% or flat amount)
- Lender fee (processing, underwriting)
- Points (discount points to lower rate)

**Example Loan Estimate:**

```
Section A: Origination Charges
- Origination Fee: $3,000 (1.00%)
- Discount Points: $0
Total: $3,000
```

**Questions to ask:**
- "What is your origination fee?" (should match Loan Estimate)
- "Is this a flat fee or percentage?" (percentage typical)
- "Can you reduce this fee if I accept higher rate?" (yes, via lender-paid comp)

---

**Step 2: Compare Borrower-Paid vs Lender-Paid Options**

Request both scenarios from loan officer:

**Scenario A: Borrower-Paid (Lower Rate, Higher Fee)**
- Rate: 6.375%
- Origination fee: $2,500
- Monthly P&I: $1,869 (on $300K)

**Scenario B: Lender-Paid (Higher Rate, Lower Fee)**
- Rate: 6.625%
- Origination fee: $0
- Monthly P&I: $1,917 (on $300K)

**Breakeven analysis:**

*Difference:*
- Upfront savings: $2,500 (Scenario B)
- Monthly payment increase: $48
- Breakeven: $2,500 / $48 = 52 months (4.3 years)

**Decision:**
- Holding <4.3 years: Choose Scenario B (lender-paid)
- Holding >4.3 years: Choose Scenario A (borrower-paid)

---

**Step 3: Negotiate Origination Fee**

Tennessee borrowers can negotiate loan officer compensation:

**Negotiation strategies:**

**1. Compare Multiple Loan Officers**

Get 3-5 Loan Estimates; use lowest fee to negotiate:

*Example:*
- Loan Officer A: 1.00% origination ($3,000 on $300K)
- Loan Officer B: 0.75% origination ($2,250 on $300K)
- Loan Officer C: 0.50% origination ($1,500 on $300K)

*Negotiation:*
> "I received a quote from [Loan Officer C] at 0.50% origination. Can you match?"

**Result:** Many loan officers reduce fees to match competition.

---

**2. Request Lender Credit**

If fee non-negotiable, request lender credit to offset closing costs:

*Example:*
- Origination fee: $3,000 (non-negotiable)
- Request: $1,500 lender credit toward title/appraisal
- Net cost: $1,500 instead of $3,000

---

**3. Accept Higher Rate to Eliminate Fee**

If cash-strapped, accept slightly higher rate for zero origination:

*Example:*
- Option A: 6.375% rate, $3,000 fee
- Option B: 6.625% rate, $0 fee (lender-paid compensation)
- Saves $3,000 upfront; costs $48/month more

---

### Tennessee Loan Officer Compensation Red Flags

**❌ Vague Fee Disclosure**

**Red flag:** Loan officer won't clearly state origination fee upfront

**What to do:** Request Loan Estimate before application; fee must be disclosed within 3 days

---

**❌ Excessive Origination Fees**

**Red flag:** Origination fee >2.00% of loan amount without justification

**Typical range:** 0.50-1.50% for Tennessee brokers; $0-$2,000 for banks

**What to do:** Compare with other loan officers; negotiate or walk away if excessive

---

**❌ Junk Fees**

**Red flag:** Unusual fees like "email fee," "document fee," "photo fee" (above reasonable amounts)

**Reasonable fees:** Processing ($300-$500), underwriting ($400-$600), appraisal ($400-$600)

**Unreasonable fees:** Email fee ($50), courier fee ($100), admin fee ($500+)

**What to do:** Question every fee in Section A; request removal of junk fees

---

**❌ Pressure to Accept Higher Rate Without Explanation**

**Red flag:** Loan officer pushes higher rate but doesn't explain compensation trade-off

**Compliant behavior:** Clearly explain borrower-paid vs lender-paid options; let borrower choose

**What to do:** Request written explanation of rate/fee options; compare breakeven analysis

---

**❌ Steering to Specific Lender Without Reason**

**Red flag:** Mortgage broker recommends one lender despite having access to 30+ lenders

**Question:** "Why this lender vs others? Do you earn more commission from this lender?"

**Compliant answer:** "All lenders pay same; I chose best rate/terms for you."

**Non-compliant answer:** Vague or defensive response; may indicate steering

*Borrower fee:*
- Origination fee: $1,500 (goes to bank, not directly to loan officer)
- Loan officer receives: $750 commission (paid by bank from revenue)

**Analysis:** Borrower pays $1,500; bank keeps portion and pays loan officer $750. Loan officer has less incentive to steer (lower commission %).

---

**Example 3: Knoxville Credit Union (Salary-Only)**

*Borrower scenario:*
- Loan amount: $200,000
- Credit score: 720

*Credit union compensation:*
- Loan officer salary: $62,000/year (no commission)
- Member origination fee: $800 (flat fee; goes to credit union operating costs)

**Analysis:** Loan officer has zero financial incentive to steer or recommend higher-cost products. Member-focused; best for borrowers wanting unbiased advice.
