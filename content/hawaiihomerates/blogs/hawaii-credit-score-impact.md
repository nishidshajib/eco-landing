## Credit Score Impact on Hawaii Mortgage Rates

Credit score has a major impact on Hawaii mortgage pricing. Lenders price by credit tier, and even a 20–40 point improvement can reduce your rate and APR significantly. Because Hawaii has higher loan balances, the monthly savings can be substantial.

### Hawaii Credit Tiers (Typical Pricing)

- **760+**: Best pricing (lowest rates and fees)
- **740–759**: ~0.125% higher
- **720–739**: ~0.25% higher
- **700–719**: ~0.50% higher
- **Below 680**: Often requires FHA or specialty programs

### Monthly Payment Impact Example

Loan amount: $600,000

- **760 tier:** $4,140/month
- **700 tier:** $4,380/month
- **Difference:** ~$240/month ($2,880/year)

### Why Credit Matters More in Hawaii

Hawaii home prices are higher than the national average. Rate changes have bigger dollar impact on higher loan balances, especially for jumbo loans.

### How to Improve Your Credit Tier

1. Pay down credit cards below 10% utilization
2. Avoid new inquiries 60–90 days before applying
3. Dispute errors and outdated negative items
4. Keep older accounts open to preserve credit age

### Bottom Line

Improving your credit tier can save thousands on Hawaii mortgages. Check your score early and plan improvements before applying.
