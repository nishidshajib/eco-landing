## Hawaii Jumbo Mortgage Rates: Honolulu, Maui, and Resort Market Pricing

Hawaii has some of the highest home values in the country, making jumbo loans common across Oahu and resort markets. Jumbo pricing can vary significantly by lender, property type, and occupancy. Borrowers in Honolulu, Wailea, and Kapalua should plan to compare multiple jumbo lenders to capture the best pricing.

### What Is a Jumbo Loan in Hawaii?

Hawaii's high-cost conforming loan limit is $1,149,825 (2025-2026). Any loan above that limit is a jumbo mortgage. Jumbo lending is common for:
- Honolulu and Kahala luxury homes
- Maui resort properties (Wailea, Kaanapali, Kapalua)
- Oceanfront homes on Kauai
- High-end homes on the North Shore and Windward Oahu

### Why Jumbo Pricing Differs

**Key drivers of jumbo pricing in Hawaii:**
- **Loan size:** Larger balances carry more risk for lenders
- **Occupancy:** Second homes and investment properties cost more
- **Property type:** Condos, oceanfront homes, and unique properties need special underwriting
- **Lender type:** Portfolio lenders can price differently than agency jumbo programs

### Honolulu Jumbo Rates

Honolulu has the most lender competition and volume. This helps keep jumbo rates closer to conforming pricing compared to other islands. Borrowers with strong credit (740+) and large down payments (25%+) can often secure the best jumbo offers.

### Maui and Resort Market Jumbo Rates

Maui jumbo rates tend to be higher due to:
- Higher concentration of second homes
- Limited lender participation
- Resort condominium underwriting requirements

Resort market pricing can run 0.25%–0.75% higher than Oahu jumbo rates.

### Portfolio vs Agency Jumbo in Hawaii

- **Agency jumbo:** Standardized guidelines, faster approval, less flexibility
- **Portfolio jumbo:** Flexible underwriting for complex income, oceanfront, or unique properties

Borrowers with complex income or unique properties often benefit from portfolio lenders, even if rates are slightly higher.

### Tips to Get the Best Hawaii Jumbo Rate

1. **Shop 3–5 lenders** including brokers with wholesale jumbo access.
2. **Compare APR** to see true costs, not just interest rate.
3. **Increase down payment** if possible to lower risk and improve rates.
4. **Document income thoroughly**, especially for self-employed borrowers.

### Bottom Line

Hawaii jumbo mortgage rates depend on island, occupancy, and lender type. Honolulu borrowers may find competitive pricing, while Maui and resort markets require specialized lenders. Comparing multiple lenders and focusing on APR is the best way to secure the lowest total cost.
