## APR vs Interest Rate in Hawaii: What Homebuyers Should Compare

Hawaii mortgage pricing varies by lender and island. To compare lenders fairly, borrowers should focus on APR (annual percentage rate), not just the interest rate. APR captures total borrowing costs, including lender fees and points.

### Interest Rate vs APR

- **Interest rate** is the cost of borrowing, applied to your loan balance.
- **APR** includes the interest rate plus lender fees, points, and closing costs.

APR gives you a better apples-to-apples comparison across Hawaii lenders, especially when fees vary by island.

### Why APR Matters More in Hawaii

Hawaii lenders often charge different fees for:
- Second homes and investment properties (common on Maui and Kauai)
- Condominiums with HOA documentation requirements
- Jumbo loans over $1,149,825

These fees can make a lower interest rate cost more overall. APR reveals that difference.

### Example: APR Comparison

Loan amount: $700,000

- **Lender A:** 6.50% rate, $4,000 in fees → APR 6.62%
- **Lender B:** 6.62% rate, $1,200 in fees → APR 6.66%

Even with a lower rate, Lender A has a higher APR because fees are higher.

### Hawaii-Specific APR Triggers

1. **Second-home pricing:** Adds 0.25%–0.75% in fees and rate
2. **Condo approval:** Some lenders charge for condo review
3. **Jumbo loans:** Higher fees for specialized underwriting
4. **Appraisal complexity:** Oceanfront and acreage properties require specialty appraisals

### How to Compare APR in Hawaii

1. Request **Loan Estimates** from 3–5 lenders
2. Review **APR, total fees, and points**
3. Ask about **island-specific fees** and occupancy pricing
4. Compare **closing timelines and underwriting flexibility**

### Bottom Line

APR is the most reliable way to compare Hawaii mortgage offers. With island-specific fees and jumbo pricing, APR comparisons can save thousands over the life of the loan.
