Wyoming borrowers often choose between credit unions and banks. Both can be competitive, but **pricing, fees, and underwriting flexibility differ significantly** depending on your property type, credit profile, and membership status.

## Credit Union Advantages in Wyoming

### 1) Lower Fees

Credit unions are member-owned, so they return profits through lower fees.

**Typical credit union fees**:
- Origination: $500–$1,500
- Processing: $300–$600

**Typical bank fees**:
- Origination: $2,000–$6,000
- Processing: $600–$1,200

**Result**: APR often lower at credit unions even if the rate is similar.

---

### 2) Member Pricing Discounts

Credit unions offer relationship-based pricing:
- 0.125%–0.25% discounts for members with deposits
- Better pricing for long-term members

**Example** ($450K loan):
- Bank: 6.750% rate, $6,000 fees
- Credit union: 6.625% rate, $2,000 fees

---

### 3) Personalized Service

Credit unions emphasize member service, often with:
- Local loan officers
- Fewer sales quotas
- More flexible guidance for borrowers

---

## Bank Advantages in Wyoming

### 1) Portfolio Lending for Rural Properties

Wyoming banks keep loans in-house for:
- Rural acreage (20+ acres)
- Ranches with agricultural income
- Properties without recent comparables

Credit unions often follow conforming guidelines that reject acreage properties.

---

### 2) Jumbo Lending Capacity

Banks can accommodate jumbo loans for:
- Jackson Hole luxury properties
- High-value custom homes in Cheyenne/Casper

Many credit unions have loan limits under $750K, restricting jumbo lending.

---

### 3) Relationship Banking Benefits

Borrowers with existing bank relationships may receive:
- Discounted rates
- Waived fees
- Faster approvals

However, relationship discounts typically **0.125% or less**—often matched by wholesale lenders.

| Credit Union | 6.625% | 6.80% | $2,000 |
| Broker Wholesale | 6.500% | 6.65% | $2,250 |

**Winner**: Broker wholesale wins on rate and APR. Credit union wins on fees vs bank.

| Credit Union | Declined | — | Acreage limit exceeded |

---

## Summary: Credit Unions vs Banks in Wyoming

**Credit unions win** on fees and member pricing for standard homes.
