Wyoming portfolio lenders keep loans in-house instead of selling to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This allows **manual underwriting** for rural properties, acreage, and ranches that conventional lenders often decline.

## What Is a Portfolio Lender?

### Portfolio Lending Definition

Portfolio lenders fund loans and keep them on their balance sheets, allowing flexibility beyond standard conforming guidelines.

**Portfolio lending enables**:
- Approvals for large acreage (20+ acres)
- Rural properties without comparable sales
- Mixed-use or ranch properties
- Complex income documentation

---

## Why Portfolio Lending Matters in Wyoming

Wyoming has unique property types:
- Ranches and agricultural properties
- Large acreage homes (40+ acres)
- Rural properties with limited comps

Conforming lenders often decline these properties due to acreage limits or appraisal challenges. Portfolio lenders fill the gap.

## Portfolio vs Conforming Lending

### Conforming Lenders

- Follow strict Fannie/Freddie guidelines
- Limit acreage (often 10–20 acres max)
- Require standardized appraisal comparables
- Automated underwriting (little flexibility)

### Portfolio Lenders

- Use manual underwriting
- Approve 20–200+ acre properties
- Accept unique comps and local market data
- Flexible on debt-to-income ratios

---

## Wyoming Portfolio Lender Use Cases

### 1) Ranch Properties (40–200 Acres)

**Challenge**: Conforming lenders often reject acreage over 20 acres.

**Portfolio Solution**: Local banks approve with manual review of land value and agricultural income.

---

### 2) Rural Properties with Limited Comps

**Challenge**: National lenders require 3+ comparable sales within 12 months.

**Portfolio Solution**: Local lenders accept older comps and local appraiser expertise.

---

### 3) Mixed-Use Properties

**Challenge**: Homes with barns, workshops, or business operations don't fit standard criteria.

**Portfolio Solution**: Manual underwriting allows blended residential/agricultural use.

---

## Portfolio Lending Pricing

Portfolio loans often carry a **0.25%–0.50% rate premium** due to:
- Higher underwriting complexity
- Reduced liquidity (loans not sold)
- Increased risk exposure

**Example**:
- Conforming rate: 6.50%
- Portfolio rate: 6.75%–7.00%

**Trade-Off**: Slightly higher rate but approval for properties that would otherwise be declined.

## Portfolio Lending Approval Tips

### 1) Prepare Strong Documentation

- Provide property details (acreage, land use, zoning)
- Submit clear appraisal comps (local appraiser recommended)
- Document agricultural income if applicable

### 2) Demonstrate Reserves

Portfolio lenders often require 6–12 months reserves. Larger reserves improve approval odds.

### 3) Expect Manual Underwriting

Loan decisions may take longer (35–50 days). Build time into your closing timeline.

- Ranch/acreage
- Rural residence
- Mixed-use

### Step 2: Compare Portfolio Lenders

Include:
- Local Wyoming banks
- Portfolio lenders with rural expertise

### Step 3: Compare APR and Fees

Portfolio lenders may have higher fees. Compare APR across portfolio options to find best true cost.

## Portfolio Lending vs USDA Loans

### USDA Loans

- 0% down payment
- Available in eligible rural areas
- Standard guidelines (acreage limits)

### Portfolio Loans

- Higher down payment
- Flexible acreage limits
- Approves unique properties USDA may decline

**Recommendation**: If property qualifies for USDA, compare USDA vs portfolio APR. USDA can be cheaper but has stricter property guidelines.

---

## Bottom Line

Wyoming portfolio lenders are essential for rural properties, ranches, and acreage loans. They provide approvals where conforming lenders decline, with a modest rate premium in exchange for flexibility.
