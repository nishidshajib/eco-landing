**New construction loan officers** specialize in financing newly built homes—whether you're buying a spec home, building custom, or navigating construction-to-permanent financing. They understand draw schedules, extended rate locks, and builder programs.

Building new construction is more complex than purchasing existing homes. These specialists help you compare construction-only loans versus construction-to-permanent options, evaluate builder incentives, and protect your financing during delays or cost overruns.
