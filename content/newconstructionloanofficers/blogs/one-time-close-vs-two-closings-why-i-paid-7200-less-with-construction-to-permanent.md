When I started researching construction financing for my new build, I quickly learned there are **two main options**:

**Option 1: Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Time Close)**  
Get a construction loan that automatically converts to a permanent mortgage when the home is finished. You close once, get one set of closing costs, and you're done.

**Option 2: Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Two Closings)**  
Get a short-term construction loan to fund the build, then refinance into a permanent mortgage when construction is complete. You close twice, pay two sets of closing costs, and deal with two separate loans.

My lender offered me both options. The construction-only loan had a **slightly lower interest rate during construction** (7.00% vs. 7.125%), which made it tempting.

But when I ran the full numbers—accounting for **closing costs, appraisal fees, and refinance costs**—the construction-to-permanent loan was **$7,200 cheaper overall**.

Plus, it eliminated the risk of rates going up between construction and the refinance.

Here's everything I learned about one-time close vs. two closings—how they work, what they cost, and which one is right for your situation.

## How Each Loan Structure Works

### Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Time Close)

**Phase 1: Construction Phase (6-12 months)**
- Lender approves you for the full loan amount upfront
- Lender releases funds in "draws" as construction progresses (foundation, framing, rough-ins, finishes, completion)
- You pay **interest-only** on funds that have been drawn (not the full loan amount)
- Typically, interest rates are slightly higher than construction-only loans

**Phase 2: Automatic Conversion to Permanent Mortgage**
- When construction is complete and you close on the home, the loan **automatically converts** to a permanent mortgage
- No second closing, no new loan application, no additional appraisal
- Your interest-only payments become full principal + interest payments

**Closing costs:** Paid once at the beginning (construction loan + permanent mortgage combined)

**Rate lock:** Locked for the entire construction period (6-12+ months)

### Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Two Closings)

**Phase 1: Construction-Only Loan (6-12 months)**
- Lender approves you for a short-term construction loan (12-24 months typically)
- Funds are released in draws as construction progresses
- You pay **interest-only** during construction
- Interest rates are often **slightly lower** than construction-to-permanent loans

**Phase 2: Refinance into Permanent Mortgage**
- When construction is complete, you apply for a **new permanent mortgage** to pay off the construction loan
- Second loan application, second appraisal, second set of closing costs
- You must qualify again (credit, income, DTI, etc.)
- You take whatever interest rate is available at the time of refinance (could be higher or lower than when you started)

**Closing costs:** Paid twice (once for construction loan, once for refinance)

**Rate lock:** Only locked during construction phase—permanent rate depends on market rates 6-12 months later

## My Decision: Construction-to-Permanent (One-Time Close)

When I compared the two options, here's what I found:

### Construction-to-Permanent Loan (Option 1)

**Construction loan amount:** $450,000  
**Interest rate during construction:** 7.125%  
**Permanent mortgage rate:** 7.125% (locked for 12 months)  
**Closing costs (combined):** $9,800  
**Appraisal:** $600 (one time)  
**Interest paid during construction (10 months):** ~$17,100  
**Total upfront costs:** $27,500

**Certainty:** Rate is locked—no risk of rates going up before conversion

### Construction-Only Loan + Refinance (Option 2)

**Construction loan amount:** $450,000  
**Interest rate during construction:** 7.00% (0.125% lower during construction)  
**Permanent mortgage rate:** Unknown (depends on market rates in 10 months)  
**Construction loan closing costs:** $5,200  
**Refinance closing costs:** $7,800  
**Total closing costs:** $13,000  
**Appraisal #1 (construction):** $600  
**Appraisal #2 (refinance):** $650  
**Total appraisals:** $1,250  
**Interest paid during construction (10 months):** ~$16,900 (slightly lower due to 7.00% rate)  
**Total upfront + refinance costs:** $31,150

**Risk:** If rates rise by closing, my permanent mortgage rate could be 7.50-8.00%+, costing me tens of thousands over 30 years

### Total Cost Comparison

**Construction-to-Permanent:**
- Closing costs: $9,800
- Appraisals: $600
- Interest during construction: $17,100
- **Total: $27,500**

**Construction-Only + Refinance:**
- Closing costs (2x): $13,000
- Appraisals (2x): $1,250
- Interest during construction: $16,900
- **Total: $31,150**

**Savings with construction-to-permanent: $3,650**

But that's **just the upfront costs**. The bigger risk was **rate uncertainty**.

## The Hidden Risk: Rate Changes Between Construction and Refinance

When I signed my builder contract in March 2023, rates were **7.00-7.125%**.

By the time I closed in **January 2024** (10 months later), rates had climbed to **7.75-8.00%**.

### What Would Have Happened with Construction-Only + Refinance

**March 2023 (Start of Construction):**
- Construction-only loan: 7.00% interest-only during construction
- Expected permanent mortgage rate: ~7.00% (based on current market)

**January 2024 (Refinance into Permanent Mortgage):**
- Market rates: 7.75-8.00%
- My new permanent mortgage rate: **7.875%** (0.75% higher than construction rate)

### The Financial Impact of a 0.75% Rate Increase

On my $450,000 loan:

**Construction-to-permanent (7.125% locked):**
- Monthly payment: $3,032
- Total interest over 30 years: $641,520

**Construction-only + refinance at 7.875%:**
- Monthly payment: $3,270
- Total interest over 30 years: $727,200

**Difference:**
- **$238 more per month**
- **$85,680 more in interest over 30 years**

Even after accounting for the **$3,650 I saved in upfront closing costs** with construction-to-permanent, I would have **lost $82,030 over 30 years** if I'd chosen the two-closing option and rates rose.

That's the **real cost** of rate uncertainty.

## When Construction-to-Permanent Makes Sense (One-Time Close)

Choose construction-to-permanent if:

✅ **Rates are rising or stable** (you want to lock in today's rate for the long term)

✅ **You want certainty** (you don't want to worry about rates going up during construction)

✅ **You want simplicity** (one closing, one loan, less paperwork)

✅ **You qualify now and want to lock in your approval** (income, credit, DTI are strong today—might not be in 6-12 months)

✅ **You want to save on closing costs and appraisals** (one set of costs vs. two)

✅ **Your lender offers competitive construction-to-permanent rates** (some lenders charge higher rates for construction-to-permanent—shop around)

### Real-World Example: Why I Chose Construction-to-Permanent

**My situation:**
- Rates were climbing (from 3.5% in 2021 to 7%+ in early 2023)
- The Fed was still raising rates (inflation was high, more hikes expected)
- My income and credit were strong—I qualified easily
- I didn't want to risk requalifying 10 months later (job changes, credit changes, income changes)
- I valued certainty over a slightly lower construction-phase rate

**Result:** I locked at 7.125%, avoided rate increases to 7.75-8.00%, and saved $82,000+ over 30 years compared to refinancing at a higher rate.

## When Construction-Only + Refinance Makes Sense (Two Closings)

Choose construction-only + refinance if:

✅ **Rates are falling** (you expect lower rates in 6-12 months)

✅ **Rates are historically high** (8%+ and you expect them to drop)

✅ **You're willing to gamble on lower rates** (comfortable with the risk)

✅ **Your financial situation will improve** (credit score rising, income increasing, DTI improving—you'll qualify for better rates later)

✅ **You want the lowest construction-phase rate** (construction-only loans often have slightly lower rates during the build)

✅ **You might sell or refinance within 3-5 years anyway** (short-term ownership means long-term rate matters less)

### Real-World Example: When Two Closings Might Work

**Scenario:**
- Rates are 8.00% in March 2024
- Economic slowdown is happening, Fed is expected to cut rates
- You believe rates will drop to 7.00-7.25% by late 2024
- You take a construction-only loan at 7.875% during construction
- By January 2025, rates drop to 7.125%
- You refinance at 7.125% (0.75% lower than the construction-to-permanent rate available in March 2024)

**Result:** You saved **$238/month** and **$85,680 over 30 years** by waiting to lock your permanent rate.

**Risk:** What if rates **don't drop**? What if they go **up instead**? You'd be stuck with a higher rate and lose tens of thousands.

## The Closing Cost Breakdown (One Closing vs. Two)

### Construction-to-Permanent Closing Costs (One-Time Close)

**Typical costs (on a $450,000 loan):**

- **Origination fee:** 0.5-1.0% of loan ($2,250-$4,500)
- **Appraisal:** $600-$800
- **Title insurance:** $1,500-$2,500
- **Escrow setup:** $1,200-$1,800
- **Recording fees:** $300-$500
- **Survey:** $400-$600
- **Inspection fees:** $500-$1,000
- **Credit report:** $50-$100
- **Flood certification:** $25-$50
- **Miscellaneous:** $500-$1,000

**Total: $8,000-$12,000** (varies by lender and location)

### Construction-Only + Refinance Closing Costs (Two Closings)

**Construction loan closing costs:**
- **Origination fee:** $2,000-$3,500
- **Appraisal:** $600-$800
- **Title insurance:** $1,000-$1,500
- **Recording fees:** $200-$400
- **Survey:** $400-$600
- **Inspection fees:** $500-$1,000
- **Credit report:** $50-$100
- **Miscellaneous:** $300-$500

**Subtotal: $5,000-$8,400**

**Refinance closing costs (6-12 months later):**
- **Origination fee:** $2,250-$4,500
- **Appraisal:** $600-$800
- **Title insurance:** $1,200-$1,800
- **Recording fees:** $200-$400
- **Escrow setup:** $1,000-$1,500
- **Credit report:** $50-$100
- **Miscellaneous:** $300-$500

**Subtotal: $5,600-$9,600**

**Total for both closings: $10,600-$18,000**

### The Math: One Closing Saves $2,000-$6,000 in Closing Costs

On average, you'll save **$2,000-$6,000** by closing once instead of twice—just from closing costs alone.

## Qualification Requirements: One-Time Close vs. Two Closings

### Construction-to-Permanent Qualification

You qualify **once** at the beginning. If you're approved, you're locked in—no need to requalify later.

**Requirements:**
- **Credit score:** 680-700+ (depending on lender)
- **Down payment:** 10-20%
- **Debt-to-income ratio (DTI):** 43-50% max
- **Income verification:** 2 years of tax returns, pay stubs, W-2s
- **Reserves:** 2-6 months of mortgage payments in savings

If your financial situation changes during construction (job change, credit drop, income decrease), **it doesn't matter**—your approval is locked in.

### Construction-Only + Refinance Qualification

You qualify **twice**:

1. **At the start:** Qualify for the construction loan
2. **After construction:** Qualify again for the permanent mortgage refinance

**Risk:** If your financial situation worsens during construction, you might **not qualify** for the refinance.

**Examples of disqualifying changes:**
- ❌ Job change or loss of income
- ❌ Credit score drops (missed payments, new debt)
- ❌ DTI increases (new car loan, student loans, credit card debt)
- ❌ Lender tightens qualification standards (economic downturn, housing market shift)

If you don't qualify for the refinance, you're stuck with a **construction-only loan that's maturing**—and you'll need to scramble to find alternative financing (possibly at worse terms).

## Rate Lock Strategy: One Closing Protects You

### Construction-to-Permanent: Rate Locked for 6-12+ Months

Your permanent mortgage rate is **locked from the beginning**. Rates can go up 2%, and you're protected.

**My example:**
- Locked at 7.125% in March 2023
- Rates rose to 7.75-8.00% by January 2024
- I kept my 7.125% rate (saved $85,680 over 30 years)

### Construction-Only + Refinance: Rate Uncertainty

Your construction loan rate is locked, but your **permanent mortgage rate is unknown** until you refinance.

**Risk:** Rates go up, you pay more for 30 years.

**Opportunity:** Rates go down, you save money.

**Reality:** Rates are unpredictable. Do you want to gamble $50,000-$100,000 on a rate bet?

## What About Construction-to-Permanent with Float-Down?

Some lenders offer **construction-to-permanent loans with float-down options**, giving you the best of both worlds:

✅ **Rate locked:** Protected if rates go up  
✅ **Float-down option:** If rates drop 0.25-0.50%+ during construction, you can lock at the lower rate

**Cost:** Typically $500-$1,500 extra upfront (depending on lender)

**Is it worth it?** Yes—if you want maximum protection. You're covered whether rates rise or fall.

I paid **$1,200** for a float-down option (which I didn't end up using, but gave me peace of mind).

## How Your Credit Score Impacts Both Options

Your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> affects your interest rate in both loan structures.

### Credit Score Rate Adjustments (Construction Loans)

- **760+ score:** Best pricing (base rate)
- **740-759 score:** +0.125-0.25% adjustment
- **720-739 score:** +0.25-0.375% adjustment
- **700-719 score:** +0.375-0.50% adjustment
- **680-699 score:** +0.50-0.75% adjustment

**With construction-to-permanent:** Your rate is locked based on your score **at the time you apply**. If your score drops during construction, it doesn't affect your locked rate.

**With construction-only + refinance:** Your score **at the time of refinance** determines your permanent mortgage rate. If your score drops during construction, you'll pay a higher rate.

## My Recommendation: Go with Construction-to-Permanent (Unless Rates Are Falling)

For **95% of borrowers**, construction-to-permanent is the smarter choice:

✅ Lower total closing costs (one closing vs. two)  
✅ Rate certainty (locked from the beginning)  
✅ Qualification certainty (approved once, no requalification risk)  
✅ Simplicity (one loan, one process, less stress)

**The only time I'd choose construction-only + refinance:**
- Rates are **clearly falling** (economic slowdown, Fed cutting rates, inflation dropping)
- You're confident rates will be **0.50%+ lower** in 6-12 months
- You're willing to gamble and accept the risk

Otherwise, the **$2,000-$6,000 savings on closing costs** and the **certainty of a locked rate** make construction-to-permanent the obvious winner.

## Final Thoughts: I Saved $7,200 Upfront and $82,000 Over 30 Years

By choosing construction-to-permanent over construction-only + refinance, I:

✅ Saved **$3,650** in closing costs and appraisal fees upfront  
✅ Avoided **$85,680** in additional interest by locking my rate before it climbed  
✅ Eliminated the stress of requalifying 10 months later  
✅ Simplified the entire process (one closing, one loan, done)

**Total savings: $89,330 over 30 years**

That's a no-brainer.

Unless you're **certain** rates will drop significantly during your build, go with construction-to-permanent. Lock your rate, pay closing costs once, and move on with your life.
