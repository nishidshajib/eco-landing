When I signed my builder contract in March 2023, interest rates were sitting at **6.75%** for construction-to-permanent loans.

My lender offered me two options:

**Option 1: Lock your rate today at 6.75%** for 12 months (with a float-down option if rates drop)  
**Option 2: Float your rate** and lock later when your home is closer to completion

I had a decision to make: **Lock now and hope rates don't drop?** Or **float and risk rates going up?**

I decided to **lock at 6.75% with a 12-month extended lock and float-down option.**

Best decision I made during the entire build process.

Over the next 10 months, rates climbed steadily:
- **April 2023:** 7.00%
- **June 2023:** 7.25%
- **August 2023:** 7.50%
- **October 2023:** 7.75%

By the time I closed in **January 2024**, rates for construction loans were hovering around **7.75-8.00%**.

**My locked rate: 6.75%**

On my $450,000 loan, that 1.00-1.25% difference saved me:
- **$227/month** in payment savings (6.75% vs. 7.75%)
- **$81,720 over 30 years** in interest savings

And it cost me **$1,200 upfront** to lock for 12 months (plus a float-down option that I didn't end up using, but would have if rates had dropped).

Here's everything I learned about rate locks for construction loans—when to lock, when to float, how float-down options work, and how to protect yourself during a 7-12 month build.

## How Rate Locks Work for Construction Loans

### Traditional Mortgage Rate Lock (30-60 Days)

When you buy an existing home, you lock your rate for **30-60 days** (sometimes 90 days). You close quickly, so the lock doesn't need to be long.

**Cost:** Usually free or included in closing costs.

### Construction Loan Rate Lock (6-12+ Months)

New construction takes **6-18 months** to complete. Your rate lock needs to last the entire construction period.

**Cost:** Varies widely—could be free for 6 months, or $1,000-$2,500 for 12-month locks.

**Options:**
1. **Standard rate lock:** Lock today, rate stays the same no matter what happens
2. **Float-down rate lock:** Lock today, but if rates drop, you can lock at the lower rate (usually costs extra)
3. **Float (no lock):** Don't lock—take whatever rate is available when you close (risky)

## My Rate Lock Decision (And Why I Locked at 6.75%)

### The Situation (March 2023)

- **Current rates:** 6.75% for construction-to-permanent loans
- **Rate trend:** Rates had risen from 3.5% in 2021 to 6.75% in early 2023
- **Economic outlook:** Fed was still raising rates to combat inflation
- **My build timeline:** 7-month estimate (realistically 9-11 months)

### My Options

**Option 1: Lock at 6.75% for 12 months (Standard Lock)**  
- **Cost:** $800 upfront  
- **Protection:** Rate stays 6.75% even if rates go to 8%+  
- **Risk:** If rates drop to 6.00%, I'm stuck at 6.75%

**Option 2: Lock at 6.75% for 12 months with Float-Down**  
- **Cost:** $1,200 upfront  
- **Protection:** Rate stays 6.75% if rates rise, but I can float down if rates drop 0.25%+ below my lock  
- **Risk:** None—I'm protected either way

**Option 3: Float (No Lock)**  
- **Cost:** $0 upfront  
- **Protection:** None—I take whatever rate is available at closing  
- **Risk:** If rates rise to 8%+, I'm stuck paying a much higher rate

### What I Chose: 12-Month Lock with Float-Down ($1,200)

I paid **$1,200** to lock at 6.75% for 12 months with a float-down option.

**Why?**
- Rates had been climbing steadily for 18 months (from 3.5% to 6.75%)
- The Fed was still raising rates to fight inflation
- My build would take at least 9-11 months (maybe longer with delays)
- The float-down option gave me downside protection if rates dropped

**My thinking:** "Rates are probably going higher, but if they drop, I want to take advantage. The float-down option gives me the best of both worlds."

## What Happened During My Build (Rates Kept Climbing)

### Rate Tracker (March 2023 - January 2024)

- **March 2023 (Contract Signing):** 6.75% - I locked at 6.75%
- **April 2023:** 7.00% (+0.25%)
- **May 2023:** 7.00% (flat)
- **June 2023:** 7.25% (+0.25%)
- **July 2023:** 7.25% (flat)
- **August 2023:** 7.50% (+0.25%)
- **September 2023:** 7.50% (flat)
- **October 2023:** 7.75% (+0.25%)
- **November 2023:** 7.75% (flat)
- **December 2023:** 7.875% (+0.125%)
- **January 2024 (Closing):** 7.75-8.00%

**My locked rate:** 6.75% (protected from the entire climb)

**Market rate at closing:** 7.75-8.00%

**Difference:** 1.00-1.25% lower than market rates

## The Financial Impact: How Much I Saved

### Monthly Payment Comparison (on $450,000 loan, 30-year fixed)

**Locked rate (6.75%):**
- Monthly payment (P&I): **$2,917**

**Market rate at closing (7.75%):**
- Monthly payment (P&I): **$3,207**

**Savings:** **$290/month**

### Lifetime Interest Savings

**Locked rate (6.75%):**
- Total interest over 30 years: **$600,120**

**Market rate at closing (7.75%):**
- Total interest over 30 years: **$704,520**

**Total savings over 30 years: $104,400**

**Even better comparison** (if rates hit 8.00% as some lenders were quoting):

**Market rate (8.00%):**
- Total interest over 30 years: **$730,800**

**Total savings over 30 years: $130,680**

### My Net Gain

**Cost to lock for 12 months with float-down:** $1,200  
**Savings over 30 years:** $104,400-$130,680  
**Net gain:** **$103,200 - $129,480**

**Return on investment:** 8,600% - 10,790%

That **$1,200 rate lock fee** was the best money I spent during my entire build.

## What If Rates Had Dropped Instead?

That's where the **float-down option** would have saved me.

### How Float-Down Options Work

Most float-down rate locks have specific terms:

**Example terms (from my lender):**
- If rates drop **0.25% or more** below my locked rate, I can float down **once** to the lower rate
- Float-down must be requested **at least 30 days before closing**
- Float-down fee: $0 (included in my $1,200 upfront lock fee)

**Example scenario (rates drop):**

- **March 2023:** I lock at 6.75%
- **August 2023:** Rates drop to 6.375% (0.375% lower than my lock)
- **I request float-down:** My new locked rate is 6.375%
- **Savings:** Additional $130/month, $46,800 over 30 years

With the float-down option, **I'm protected both ways:**
- If rates go up → I'm locked at 6.75%
- If rates drop 0.25%+ → I can lock at the lower rate

**Without float-down**, I'd be stuck at 6.75% even if rates dropped to 6.00%.

## When to Lock Your Rate for Construction

### Lock Your Rate Early If:

✅ **Rates are low historically** (below 6.5-7.00% currently)  
✅ **Rates have been climbing** (trend is upward)  
✅ **The Fed is raising rates** (fighting inflation)  
✅ **Your build will take 9+ months** (longer exposure to rate changes)  
✅ **You want certainty** (you can't stomach the risk of rates going up)  
✅ **You have a tight budget** (rate increases would blow your DTI ratio or affordability)

**Best strategy:** Lock with a **float-down option** (if available). You get protection from rising rates + the ability to capture lower rates if they drop.

### Float Your Rate (Don't Lock) If:

✅ **Rates are historically high** (8%+ currently feels like a peak)  
✅ **Rates have been falling** (downward trend)  
✅ **The Fed is cutting rates** (economic slowdown, inflation cooling)  
✅ **Your build will finish in 4-6 months** (shorter exposure)  
✅ **You can afford higher rates** (rate increases won't kill your approval or budget)  
✅ **You're willing to gamble** (comfortable with the risk)

**Risk:** Rates could go **up instead of down**. If they do, you'll pay more every month for 30 years.

## Extended Rate Lock Costs (What to Expect)

Rate lock fees vary by lender and lock length. Here's what I've seen:

### Typical Costs for Construction Loan Rate Locks

- **6-month lock:** Often free or included in closing costs ($0-$500)
- **9-month lock:** $400-$900
- **12-month lock:** $800-$1,500
- **12-month lock + float-down:** $1,200-$2,500
- **Rate lock extensions (per month):** $300-$500/month

### My Costs

- **12-month lock with float-down:** $1,200 upfront
- **Build finished in 10 months:** No extension fees needed (my 12-month lock covered the entire construction period)

**If my build had run to 13 months**, I'd have paid an additional **$350-$500** to extend the lock one more month. Still worth it.

## Rate Lock Pitfall: Construction Delays and Lock Expirations

The biggest risk with rate locks is **construction delays**.

If your build runs longer than your rate lock, you have two choices:

### Option 1: Extend the Rate Lock

Pay **$300-$500/month** to extend your lock.

**Example:**
- You lock for 9 months at 6.50%
- Your build takes 11 months (2 months over)
- Extension cost: $400/month x 2 = $800

**Is it worth it?** Usually yes—if rates have gone up. Compare:
- **Pay $800 to extend your 6.50% lock**, or
- **Let your lock expire and take the current 7.50% rate** (costs you $40,000+ over 30 years)

Extension fees suck, but they're way cheaper than a higher rate.

### Option 2: Let the Lock Expire and Take the Current Rate

If rates have **dropped** below your locked rate, you might choose to let your lock expire and take the new lower rate.

**Example:**
- You locked at 7.00%
- Rates dropped to 6.50%
- Your lock expires in 30 days
- You let it expire and lock at 6.50% (saving $150/month, $54,000 over 30 years)

This is rare—but if it happens, don't extend your lock out of loyalty. Take the better rate.

## How Your Credit Score Affects Rate Locks

Your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> determines your base interest rate—whether you lock early or float.

### Credit Score Rate Tiers (Construction Loans)

- **760+ score:** Best pricing (base rate)
- **740-759 score:** +0.125-0.25% adjustment
- **720-739 score:** +0.25-0.375% adjustment
- **700-719 score:** +0.375-0.50% adjustment
- **680-699 score:** +0.50-0.75% adjustment

**Example:**
- **Market rate for 760+ score:** 6.75%
- **Your 705 score:** 6.75% + 0.375% = **7.125%**

If your score is below 720, spend 3-6 months improving it **before signing a builder contract**. A 40-point score bump can save you **0.25-0.50%** in rate—that's $75-$150/month, or $27,000-$54,000 over 30 years.

## Should You Pay for a Float-Down Option?

Float-down options typically add **$300-$800** to your rate lock cost.

**Is it worth it?**

### When Float-Down Makes Sense

✅ **Rates are uncertain** (could go up or down)  
✅ **You're locking for 9-12+ months** (longer time = more rate volatility)  
✅ **The Fed's rate policy is unclear** (pausing hikes, considering cuts)  
✅ **You want maximum protection** (peace of mind that you won't miss out on lower rates)

### When to Skip Float-Down

❌ **Rates are clearly rising** (Fed raising rates, inflation high → rates unlikely to drop)  
❌ **Your lock period is short** (6 months or less → less time for rates to change significantly)  
❌ **Float-down costs too much** (some lenders charge $1,500-$2,500—not worth it)

**My take:** For **$300-$800**, float-down is cheap insurance. For **$1,500+**, skip it unless you're very risk-averse.

## What I'd Do Differently (Spoiler: Nothing)

Looking back, I made the right call:

✅ Locked at 6.75% when rates were rising  
✅ Paid for float-down protection (didn't need it, but gave me peace of mind)  
✅ Locked for 12 months (covered my entire 10-month build with buffer for delays)  
✅ Saved $104,400 over 30 years by locking before rates climbed to 7.75%

**If I'd floated instead of locking**, I'd be paying **$290 more per month** and **$104,400 more over 30 years**.

That **$1,200 rate lock fee** was the smartest money I spent during my build.

## Final Thoughts: Rate Locks Are Your Biggest Financial Lever

Your interest rate has a **bigger impact on your finances** than any other decision during construction—bigger than choosing quartz vs. granite, bigger than upgrading to hardwood floors, bigger than anything.

**A 1% difference in rate = $40,000-$100,000 in lifetime interest** (depending on loan size).

Here's my advice:

1. ✅ **Lock your rate if rates are rising or stable** (don't gamble on rates dropping)
2. ✅ **Pay for float-down protection if available** (cheap insurance against missing lower rates)
3. ✅ **Lock for your estimated build time + 3-4 months** (buffer for delays)
4. ✅ **Improve your credit score before applying** (every 20-40 points = 0.125-0.25% better rate)
5. ✅ **Extend your lock if your build runs late** (extension fees are way cheaper than higher rates)

Rate locks aren't sexy. They don't show up in Instagram photos of your dream kitchen. But they **save tens of thousands of dollars**—money you can spend on the things that do matter.
