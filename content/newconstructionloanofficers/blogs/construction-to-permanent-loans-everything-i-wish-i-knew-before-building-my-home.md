When my wife and I decided to build our dream home three years ago, everyone warned us: "Construction is expensive, stressful, and always takes longer than you think." They were right—but what nobody explained was how **construction financing** actually works.

I spent weeks researching construction loans, getting confused by terms like "construction-to-permanent," "one-time close," "draw schedules," and "interest-only payments." By the time I figured it out, we were already under contract with a builder and scrambling to find the right financing.

Looking back, I wish I'd understood construction-to-permanent loans from the beginning. Here's everything I learned—the good, the bad, and the surprisingly manageable parts of financing a new home build.

## What Is a Construction-to-Permanent Loan?

A construction-to-permanent loan (also called a "one-time close" construction loan) is a **single loan that covers both the construction phase and the permanent mortgage**.

### How It Works

**Phase 1: Construction (6-12 Months)**
- You make interest-only payments on the money the lender has released (drawn) to the builder
- The lender releases funds in stages ("draws") as construction progresses
- An inspector verifies work is complete before each draw
- Your interest rate is locked for the entire construction period

**Phase 2: Conversion to Permanent Mortgage**
- When construction is complete and you receive a certificate of occupancy, the loan automatically converts to a traditional mortgage
- You start making principal + interest payments
- No second closing, no second set of closing costs
- Your original locked rate becomes your permanent mortgage rate

### Real-Life Example: My Construction-to-Permanent Loan

**Loan amount:** $450,000  
**Construction period:** 9 months (estimated 7 months, but delays happen)  
**Interest rate:** 7.25% (locked before construction started)  
**Interest-only payments during construction:** $2,150-$2,700/month (varied based on how much was drawn)  
**Permanent mortgage payment after conversion:** $3,075/month (principal + interest)

The best part? **One closing.** I paid closing costs once instead of twice (construction loan + permanent mortgage), saving about $8,000-$12,000 compared to a two-loan structure.

## Construction-to-Permanent vs. Two-Loan Construction Financing

When I started researching, I quickly realized there are **two main ways** to finance new construction:

### Option 1: Construction-to-Permanent (One-Time Close)
- **One loan, one closing**
- Lock your rate before construction starts
- Lower total closing costs
- Easier process—everything is set up from the beginning

### Option 2: Construction-Only Loan + Permanent Mortgage (Two Closings)
- **Two separate loans, two closings**
- Construction-only loan funds the build (usually 12 months max)
- At completion, you apply for a new mortgage to pay off the construction loan
- Higher total closing costs (pay twice)
- More risk—you might not qualify for the permanent mortgage if your financial situation changes during construction

**Why I chose construction-to-permanent:** The thought of going through underwriting, appraisal, and closing twice sounded exhausting (and expensive). Locking my rate upfront also protected me from rate increases during construction.

## How Construction Draw Schedules Work

This was the part that confused me most. Unlike a traditional mortgage where you get all the money at closing, construction loans release funds in **stages** (called draws) as work progresses.

### Typical Draw Schedule

**Draw 1: Land + Foundation (20-25% of loan)**
- Released after foundation is poured and inspected

**Draw 2: Framing + Rough-Ins (25-30%)**
- Released after framing, roofing, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC rough-ins are complete

**Draw 3: Drywall + Exterior (20-25%)**
- Released after drywall, windows, doors, and exterior finishes are complete

**Draw 4: Interior Finishes (15-20%)**
- Released after flooring, cabinets, countertops, and interior finishes are installed

**Draw 5: Final Completion (10-15%)**
- Released after final inspection, punch list completion, and certificate of occupancy

### My Draw Experience

Our lender required an **inspector to verify work** before releasing each draw. This added 3-5 days to every draw request, which sometimes delayed our builder's schedule when subcontractors were waiting for payment.

But here's the upside: the inspection process **protected us from shoddy work**. The inspector caught issues we never would have noticed (improper flashing, HVAC duct leaks, etc.) before the builder got paid—giving us leverage to demand fixes.

**Tip:** Budget an extra **10-15 days per draw** for inspection and funding delays. Your builder will appreciate realistic expectations.

## Interest-Only Payments During Construction (And Why They Vary)

During construction, you only pay interest on the amount the lender has released—not the full loan amount.

### How My Payments Changed

**Month 1-2 (Foundation):** $90,000 drawn → $544/month interest-only  
**Month 3-4 (Framing):** $200,000 drawn → $1,208/month interest-only  
**Month 5-6 (Rough-Ins):** $315,000 drawn → $1,903/month interest-only  
**Month 7-8 (Drywall/Exterior):** $405,000 drawn → $2,448/month interest-only  
**Month 9 (Final):** $450,000 drawn → $2,719/month interest-only

**Total interest paid during construction:** ~$15,200

This was way cheaper than paying rent ($2,200/month) while building, but it required careful cash flow management because the payment jumped $300-$500 every month or two.

## Rate Locks: The Hidden Advantage of Construction-to-Permanent Loans

One of the **best decisions** I made was locking my rate before construction started.

### What Happened to Rates During My Build

**When I locked (January 2022):** 7.25%  
**During construction (March-October 2022):** Rates rose to 8.00-8.50%  
**Savings from locking early:** ~$225/month for 30 years = **$81,000 saved**

If I'd done a two-loan structure (construction-only + permanent mortgage), I would have been applying for my permanent mortgage in October 2022 at 8.25%+ rates. Locking early with a construction-to-permanent loan **saved my family tens of thousands of dollars**.

### Extended Rate Lock Periods

Construction-to-permanent loans typically offer **6-12 month rate locks**—much longer than traditional purchase loans (30-60 days).

Some lenders also offer **float-down options**, which let you lock at a lower rate if rates drop during construction. Ask about this before applying—it can save you money if rates fall while you're building.

## Credit Score Requirements for Construction-to-Permanent Loans

Construction loans have **stricter requirements** than traditional mortgages because they're riskier for lenders (you're financing something that doesn't exist yet).

### Typical Requirements

- **Minimum credit score:** 680+ (some lenders require 700+)
- **Down payment:** 10-20% (more is better)
- **Debt-to-income ratio:** Under 43% (ideally under 40%)
- **Cash reserves:** 6-12 months of payments in savings
- **Detailed construction plans and builder contract** required for approval

### How My Credit Score Affected My Rate

My <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> was 712 when I applied. My lender quoted me 7.25% for construction-to-permanent financing.

My neighbor applied two months later with a 680 score and got quoted 7.875%—a **0.625% difference** that cost him about $150/month more (on a similar loan amount).

**Lesson:** If your score is below 700, spend 3-6 months improving it before applying for construction financing. The savings far outweigh the wait.

## Down Payment: How Much Do You Really Need?

Most construction-to-permanent loans require **10-20% down**, though some lenders offer programs with as little as 5% down for qualified buyers.

### My Down Payment Strategy

We put **15% down ($67,500)** on our $450,000 build. Here's where the money came from:

- **Savings:** $40,000
- **Cash-out refinance from our previous home:** $27,500 (sold later during construction)

Using <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a> proceeds from our starter home as part of our down payment let us avoid depleting our emergency fund. We sold that home mid-construction and used the proceeds to pay off the cash-out refi balance.

**Alternative down payment sources:**
- Sale of current home (if selling before building)
- Gift funds from family
- Equity from land you already own
- 401(k) loan (not ideal, but some people do it)

Larger down payments = lower rates and easier approval.

## Hidden Costs Nobody Tells You About

Beyond closing costs and down payment, there were surprise expenses I didn't budget for:

### 1. Builder Contract Changes ($$$$)
We made design changes mid-construction (upgraded countertops, added a gas line for the stove, changed light fixtures). Every change order added to our loan amount and cost—**total extra: $8,500**.

### 2. Landscaping (Not Included in Base Contract)
Our builder's contract didn't include landscaping beyond basic grading and sod. We spent **$6,000** on trees, shrubs, irrigation, and mulch after closing.

### 3. Window Treatments
Builders don't include blinds or curtains. We spent **$3,200** on window treatments for a 2,400 sq ft home.

### 4. Temporary Housing
Our lease ended before construction finished, so we moved into an Airbnb for two months—**$5,400** in unexpected housing costs.

### 5. Interest During Construction
As mentioned earlier, interest-only payments during construction totaled **~$15,200**. This isn't a "cost" per se (you'd pay interest anyway), but you need cash flow to cover it.

**Total unexpected costs:** ~$38,300

**Lesson:** Budget an extra 10-15% beyond your loan amount for surprises, changes, and expenses not covered by the builder.

## Construction Delays: What Happens If Your Build Takes Longer?

Our builder estimated **7 months** to completion. It took **9 months**.

### Why Delays Happen
- **Material shortages** (our windows were delayed 6 weeks)
- **Weather** (rain delayed foundation work twice)
- **Subcontractor scheduling issues** (electrician was backed up 3 weeks)
- **Permit delays** (city inspections took longer than expected)

### How Delays Affect Financing

**Rate lock extensions:** Most construction-to-permanent loans include a 6-9 month rate lock with extensions available if construction runs long. I paid **$350** for a 60-day rate lock extension when our build went past 7 months.

**Longer interest-only period:** More months of interest-only payments = more cash outflow. Budget accordingly.

**Appraisal updates:** If construction takes significantly longer (12+ months), some lenders require an updated appraisal—adding $500-$800 in costs.

## Would I Do It Again? Absolutely.

Despite the stress, delays, and surprises, building our home with construction-to-permanent financing was **100% worth it**.

### What I Loved
- **One closing = lower costs** (saved ~$10,000 vs two-loan structure)
- **Locked rate protected me from rate increases** (saved ~$80,000 over 30 years)
- **Customization** (we got exactly what we wanted instead of compromising on an existing home)
- **Everything is new** (no repairs, no surprises, 10-year structural warranty)

### What I'd Do Differently
- **Budget an extra 20% for surprises** (we budgeted 10%, which wasn't enough)
- **Improve my credit score before applying** (could have saved another 0.25% on my rate)
- **Ask more questions about draw schedules upfront** (would have set better expectations with our builder)
- **Shop multiple construction loan officers** (I went with the first one who approved me—rookie mistake)

## How to Get Started with Construction-to-Permanent Financing

### Step 1: Improve Your Credit Score
If your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">middle credit score</a> is below 700, spend a few months improving it before applying. Every 20-point increase can save you 0.125-0.25% in interest.

### Step 2: Save for Down Payment + Reserves
Aim for 15-20% down plus 6 months of payments in savings. Lenders want to see you can handle construction costs without going broke.

### Step 3: Choose Your Builder and Get a Contract
You'll need a signed builder contract with detailed plans, specifications, and a construction timeline before applying for financing.

### Step 4: Shop Multiple Construction Loan Officers
Don't accept the first offer. Compare rates, fees, draw schedules, and rate lock terms from at least 3 lenders.

Connect with verified construction loan officers through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> to compare construction-to-permanent loan options and find the best financing for your new home build.

### Step 5: Lock Your Rate and Start Building
Once approved, lock your rate (especially if rates are rising), finalize your builder contract, and break ground on your dream home.

## Final Thoughts: Construction-to-Permanent Loans Simplify a Complex Process

Building a home is complicated enough without worrying about two separate loans and two closings. Construction-to-permanent financing simplifies the process, saves money on closing costs, and protects you from rate increases during construction.

Yes, there are surprises. Yes, construction takes longer than you think. And yes, it's stressful at times.

But when you walk into your brand-new home—built exactly how you want it, with no compromises—it's all worth it.

If you're considering new construction, start by understanding your financing options, improving your credit, and connecting with experienced construction loan officers who can guide you through the process from contract to closing.

Your dream home is possible—you just need the right financing strategy to make it happen.
