Three months after moving into my beautiful new construction home, I noticed a dark stain spreading across my dining room ceiling.

Water damage.

I called my builder immediately, confident my warranty would cover it. The sales rep had told me, **"Everything's covered for at least a year—you're fully protected!"**

The builder sent an inspector. His conclusion: **"Roof installation looks fine. This is likely condensation from your HVAC system. Not covered under warranty."**

I called an independent roofing contractor for a second opinion. His assessment: **"Your roof flashing was installed incorrectly. Water's getting in around the chimney. This is 100% a construction defect."**

I went back to the builder with the independent report. They pushed back. We argued for six weeks. Eventually, they agreed to fix it—but I had to pay a **$1,200 "inspection and diagnostic fee"** and handle the ceiling repair myself (**$2,800**).

Total out-of-pocket: **$4,000** for a defect that should have been covered.

That was just the beginning. Over my first 18 months in the home, I filed seven warranty claims. Three were fully covered, two were partially covered, and two were denied outright.

Total cost for "covered" items: **$8,400** in out-of-pocket repairs.

Here's everything I learned about new home warranties—what's really covered, what's not, and how to protect yourself before, during, and after you close.

## How New Home Warranties Actually Work

Most new construction homes come with **two types of warranties**:

### 1. Builder's Warranty (1-2 Years)

Covers **workmanship and materials** installed by the builder or their subcontractors:

- Structural defects (foundation, framing, roof structure)
- Plumbing and electrical systems
- HVAC installation issues
- Windows and doors
- Flooring, drywall, paint
- Cabinets, countertops, fixtures

**Here's the catch:** Builders often argue that problems are caused by **homeowner negligence** or **normal wear and tear**—not construction defects.

### 2. Structural Warranty (10 Years)

Covers **major structural defects** like:

- Foundation cracks or settling issues
- Load-bearing wall failures
- Roof structural failure (not leaks—just structural collapse)
- Floor joist or beam failures

**Here's the catch:** The bar for "structural defect" is **very high**. Cosmetic cracks, minor settling, or leaks usually don't qualify.

## My Real Warranty Claims (And How They Went)

### Claim #1: Water Damage from Roof Flashing (Month 3)

**Problem:** Water stain on dining room ceiling after heavy rain  
**Builder's response:** "Not a construction defect—likely HVAC condensation"  
**My response:** Hired independent contractor who found improper flashing  
**Outcome:** Builder fixed flashing after 6-week dispute, but I paid $1,200 diagnostic fee + $2,800 for ceiling repair  
**Total cost to me:** **$4,000**

### Claim #2: HVAC System Not Heating Upstairs (Month 5)

**Problem:** Second floor bedrooms stayed 5-8°F colder than downstairs  
**Builder's response:** "System is working as designed"  
**My response:** Hired HVAC engineer who found undersized ductwork and improper balancing  
**Outcome:** Builder adjusted dampers (free) but refused to upgrade ductwork  
**Total cost to me:** **$0 (but problem not fully fixed)**

### Claim #3: Garage Door Opener Failed (Month 7)

**Problem:** Garage door opener stopped working  
**Builder's response:** "This is a manufacturer defect—contact the manufacturer"  
**My response:** Called opener company, they said installation was faulty  
**Outcome:** Builder replaced opener under warranty (free)  
**Total cost to me:** **$0**

### Claim #4: Hardwood Floor Gaps and Cupping (Month 9)

**Problem:** Living room hardwood developed large gaps (up to 1/4") and cupping  
**Builder's response:** "This is normal seasonal wood movement—not covered"  
**My response:** Flooring inspector found improper acclimation before installation  
**Outcome:** Builder refused to fix (outside 90-day flooring warranty period)  
**Total cost to me:** **$3,400 to sand and refinish floors**

### Claim #5: Kitchen Cabinet Door Misalignment (Month 11)

**Problem:** Six cabinet doors wouldn't close properly  
**Builder's response:** "We'll send someone out"  
**Outcome:** Builder adjusted hinges under warranty (free)  
**Total cost to me:** **$0**

### Claim #6: Basement Window Leaking (Month 14)

**Problem:** Water pooled inside basement window well after rain  
**Builder's response:** "Window installation is fine—this is a grading issue, which is only covered for 1 year"  
**My response:** Landscape contractor found improper grading directing water toward foundation  
**Outcome:** Builder refused to fix (outside 1-year grading warranty)  
**Total cost to me:** **$1,000 to regrade and install drainage**

### Claim #7: Foundation Crack (Month 16)

**Problem:** Hairline crack appeared in basement foundation wall  
**Builder's response:** "This is normal settling—not structural"  
**My response:** Structural engineer said crack is within normal limits but should be monitored  
**Outcome:** Builder sealed crack under 10-year structural warranty (free)  
**Total cost to me:** **$0**

**Total out-of-pocket costs: $8,400** for issues that **should have been covered** but were disputed or denied.

## What's REALLY Covered by New Home Warranties

### Definitely Covered (Usually)

✅ **Structural defects** (foundation failures, major cracks, structural settling)  
✅ **Major system failures** (HVAC, plumbing, electrical—if defect is due to installation)  
✅ **Roof leaks** from installation defects (within 1-2 years)  
✅ **Window and door installation issues** (won't close, air leaks, water intrusion)  
✅ **Appliance failures** (covered by manufacturer, not builder—but builder coordinates)  
✅ **Workmanship defects** (poor drywall, paint, trim, flooring—within 90 days to 1 year)

### Sometimes Covered (Depends on Builder and Contract)

⚠️ **Cosmetic defects** (paint touch-ups, minor drywall cracks, nail pops—often 30-90 day window)  
⚠️ **HVAC sizing or design issues** (many builders argue "system works as designed")  
⚠️ **Grading and drainage** (usually covered for 1 year, then homeowner responsibility)  
⚠️ **Settling cracks** (minor cracks often excluded as "normal settling")  
⚠️ **Flooring issues** (gaps, cupping, squeaks—often short 90-day warranty period)

### Never Covered

❌ **Normal wear and tear** (scuffed floors, worn carpet, faded paint)  
❌ **Homeowner negligence** (clogged gutters causing leaks, frozen pipes, pest damage)  
❌ **Landscaping** (dead grass, shrubs, trees—usually 30-90 days max)  
❌ **Manufacturer defects on appliances** (covered by manufacturer, not builder)  
❌ **Upgrades or changes** you made after closing  
❌ **Damage from natural disasters** (flooding, storms, earthquakes—covered by homeowner's insurance)

## The Fine Print: Why Warranty Claims Get Denied

### 1. "That's Normal Wear and Tear"

Builders love this excuse. Hardwood gaps? "Normal seasonal movement." Drywall cracks? "Normal settling." Paint fading? "Normal wear."

**How to fight it:** Hire an independent contractor or inspector to document that the issue is a **construction defect**, not normal wear.

### 2. "You Didn't Report It in Time"

Many warranties have **short reporting windows**:
- Cosmetic defects: 30-90 days
- Flooring: 90 days to 1 year
- Workmanship: 1 year
- Structural: 10 years

Miss the window by one day? Claim denied.

**How to avoid it:** Document **everything** during your walkthrough and first 90 days. Take photos, videos, and detailed notes. Submit claims in writing immediately.

### 3. "This Is a Manufacturer Defect, Not a Builder Defect"

Appliance breaks? Builder says "Call the manufacturer." Manufacturer says "Installation was faulty—call the builder."

You get stuck in the middle.

**How to fight it:** Get written documentation from the manufacturer stating whether the issue is a **product defect** or **installation defect**. If installation, the builder must fix it.

### 4. "You Didn't Maintain It Properly"

Builder argues you didn't clean gutters, change HVAC filters, or maintain grading—so the defect is your fault.

**How to avoid it:** Keep receipts and records of all maintenance (HVAC service, gutter cleaning, landscaping). Prove you maintained the home properly.

## How to Protect Yourself: Pre-Closing Walkthrough Checklist

Your **final walkthrough** is your **last chance** to document defects before closing. Builders are much more responsive **before closing** than after.

### What to Bring

- **Camera/phone** for photos and videos
- **Notebook** for detailed notes
- **Contractor or inspector** (optional but helpful for major issues)
- **Builder's warranty policy** (review coverage and exclusions beforehand)

### What to Check (Room by Room)

✅ **Walls and ceilings:** Cracks, nail pops, uneven texture, paint quality  
✅ **Floors:** Squeaks, gaps, levelness, transitions, grout cracks  
✅ **Windows and doors:** Open/close smoothly, lock properly, no air leaks, screens included  
✅ **Kitchen:** Appliances work, cabinets aligned, countertops level, plumbing no leaks  
✅ **Bathrooms:** Fixtures work, no leaks, grout/caulk complete, ventilation fans work  
✅ **HVAC:** Heat/AC working in all rooms, vents open/close, temperature balanced  
✅ **Electrical:** All outlets work (bring outlet tester), switches control correct lights/fans, panel labeled  
✅ **Plumbing:** Flush toilets, run faucets, check water pressure, look under sinks for leaks  
✅ **Exterior:** Grading slopes away from foundation, gutters attached, siding complete, roof looks straight

### What to Document

- **Take photos of EVERYTHING** (even if it looks fine—you have proof later)
- **Create a punch list** of items needing repair (give to builder in writing)
- **Don't close until punch list is resolved** (you lose leverage after closing)

I made the mistake of closing with a 12-item punch list that the builder "promised" to fix after closing. Six months later, half the items were still unresolved.

## The 11-Month Warranty Walk: Don't Skip It

Most builder warranties expire at **12 months** for workmanship issues. Schedule your **11-month warranty walk** to document any defects before the warranty expires.

### What to Check

- Items from your original punch list that were "fixed" (did they actually fix them properly?)
- New issues that appeared during the first year (cracks, leaks, floor squeaks, HVAC problems)
- Seasonal issues you might have missed (ice dams in winter, HVAC cooling in summer)

Submit your 11-month punch list **in writing** with photos. Give the builder time to schedule repairs before the 1-year warranty expires.

## How to File a Warranty Claim (And Actually Get It Approved)

### Step 1: Document the Issue Thoroughly

- **Photos and videos** showing the defect from multiple angles
- **Dates and timeline** (when you first noticed it, how it's progressed)
- **Impact on home** (is it cosmetic? Functional? Safety issue?)

### Step 2: Review Your Warranty Policy

Check:
- Is this issue covered?
- Are you within the reporting window?
- What's the process for filing a claim?

### Step 3: Submit Your Claim in Writing

**Email or certified mail** to the builder with:
- Description of the issue
- Photos/videos attached
- Reference to warranty coverage
- Request for inspection and repair

Don't just call—**always follow up in writing** to create a paper trail.

### Step 4: Follow Up Persistently

Builders are slow to respond. Follow up weekly until they schedule an inspection.

### Step 5: Get a Second Opinion if Denied

If the builder denies your claim, hire an independent contractor or inspector to provide a written report proving it's a **construction defect**.

Present the report to the builder and escalate if necessary.

### Step 6: Escalate if Needed

If the builder still refuses:
- **Contact the warranty company** (if the home has third-party warranty coverage like 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty)
- **File a complaint** with your state's contractor licensing board
- **Consult an attorney** (for major defects worth $10,000+)

## What About Third-Party Warranties?

Some builders provide **third-party structural warranties** through companies like:

- **2-10 Home Buyers Warranty**
- **HOW (Home Owners Warranty)**
- **Quality Built Warranty**

These companies provide **dispute resolution** if the builder refuses to honor the warranty. They also continue coverage if the builder goes out of business.

**Worth it?** Yes—especially for major structural issues. If your builder offers third-party warranty coverage, take it.

## How Your Construction Financing Affects Warranty Coverage

Your construction loan doesn't directly affect warranty coverage, but it does affect your ability to **hold funds in escrow** until punch list items are completed.

With a <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">construction-to-permanent loan</a>, your lender releases final payment to the builder at closing. Once the money is released, you lose leverage.

**What I should have done:** Negotiated to hold **5-10% of the purchase price in escrow** until all punch list items were completed. Most builders resist this—but it's worth trying.

## Final Thoughts: Trust, But Verify (And Document Everything)

I love my home. My builder did a good job overall. But I learned the hard way that **"covered under warranty" doesn't always mean "covered for free."**

Builders will push back on claims, argue about coverage, and sometimes deny legitimate defects. It's not personal—it's business.

Here's how to protect yourself:

1. ✅ **Do a thorough final walkthrough** (bring a contractor if possible)
2. ✅ **Don't close until major defects are fixed** (you lose leverage after closing)
3. ✅ **Document everything** (photos, videos, written notes—create a paper trail)
4. ✅ **Submit claims in writing** (email or certified mail—never just phone calls)
5. ✅ **Get independent inspections** if claims are denied (second opinions matter)
6. ✅ **Schedule your 11-month warranty walk** (don't miss the deadline)
7. ✅ **Keep all maintenance records** (prove you maintained the home properly)

New home warranties provide real protection—but only if you understand the fine print and fight for your rights when needed.

Don't assume "everything's covered." Read your warranty policy, document defects immediately, and be prepared to push back if the builder tries to deny legitimate claims.
