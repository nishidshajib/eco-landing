Wyoming borrowers often wonder whether to use a mortgage broker or go directly to a bank. The answer depends on property type, pricing goals, and underwriting flexibility. **Brokers typically win on rate and lender access**, while banks win on rural portfolio approvals.

## Broker vs Bank: Core Differences

### Mortgage Brokers

- Access 20+ wholesale lenders
- Wholesale pricing 0.125%–0.375% lower than retail
- One application, multiple lender quotes
- Flexible underwriting options

### Banks

- Single-lender programs (retail pricing)
- Portfolio lending for rural/acreage properties
- Relationship banking discounts (usually small)
- Local decision-making for unique properties

## Rate Comparison Example

### $450K Conventional (Cheyenne)

| Lender Type | Rate | APR | Fees |
|-------------|------|-----|------|
| Local Bank | 6.750% | 6.95% | $6,500 |
| Broker Wholesale | 6.500% | 6.65% | $2,250 |

**Broker Savings**:
- 0.25% lower rate = $76/month savings
- $4,250 lower fees

---

## Rural Property Example

### $600K Ranch (40 Acres)

| Lender Type | Approval | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|----------|------|-------|
| Broker (Wholesale Only) | Declined | — | Conforming acreage limit exceeded |
| Local Bank (Portfolio) | Approved | 6.875% | Manual underwriting |
| Broker with Portfolio Access | Approved | 6.750% | Portfolio lender match |

**Winner**: Portfolio lender access wins for rural properties.

## When Brokers Win

- Standard conforming loans (Cheyenne/Casper)
- Borrowers seeking lowest rate/APR
- Jumbo loans needing multiple lender comparison
- Fast shopping across multiple lenders

## When Banks Win

- Rural properties with acreage
- Properties without comps
- Borrowers needing portfolio underwriting

---

## How to Decide

1. **If property is standard** → Broker wholesale usually best rate
2. **If property is rural/acreage** → Bank or broker with portfolio access
3. **If property is jumbo/luxury** → Broker with luxury lenders

---

## Questions to Ask

- "How many lenders do you work with?"
- "Can you show wholesale rate sheets?"
- "Do you have portfolio lender access for acreage?"
- "What's your compensation structure?"

---

## Bottom Line

Wyoming mortgage brokers typically deliver **lower rates and more lender options**. Banks remain valuable for portfolio lending on rural properties. The best strategy is to **compare both** for your specific property type.
