Wyoming mortgage brokers provide access to **wholesale pricing**, which is typically 0.125%–0.375% lower than retail bank rates for the same lender. Understanding wholesale pricing helps borrowers save money and compare true costs.

## What Is Wholesale Pricing?

Wholesale pricing is discounted mortgage rates offered to brokers who originate loans in volume.

**Why it’s lower**:
- Lenders save on marketing costs (brokers bring clients)
- Brokers submit complete, pre-qualified files
- Lenders reward volume with lower pricing

---

## Same Lender, Lower Rate

Example using a national lender:

- **Retail direct**: 6.750% rate
- **Wholesale via broker**: 6.500% rate

**Savings**: 0.25% = ~$76/month on a $450K loan

---

## Wholesale Rate Sheet Access

Wyoming brokers use pricing engines like:
- Optimal Blue
- Mortech
- LenderPrice

These systems compare 20+ lenders in real time, allowing brokers to identify the lowest APR combination for each borrower.

---

## Wholesale Savings Example

### $450K Conventional Loan

| Lender Channel | Rate | APR | Fees |
|----------------|------|-----|------|
| Retail Bank | 6.750% | 6.95% | $6,500 |
| Broker Wholesale | 6.500% | 6.65% | $2,250 |

**Total Savings**: ~$9,000 over 5 years (rate + fee difference)

---

## When Wholesale Pricing Wins

- Standard conforming loans
- Strong credit (720+)
- Borrowers comparing multiple lenders

## When Wholesale May Not Win

- Rural acreage requiring portfolio lenders
- Credit union member pricing occasionally matches wholesale

---

## Borrower-Paid vs Lender-Paid

Brokers can be compensated two ways:

1) **Borrower-Paid**: Lower rate, upfront fee
2) **Lender-Paid**: Higher rate, no upfront fee

Ask brokers to show both options and compare breakeven timelines.

---

## Bottom Line

Wholesale pricing is the broker advantage. Wyoming borrowers often save **0.125%–0.375% on rates** plus lower fees compared to retail banks.
