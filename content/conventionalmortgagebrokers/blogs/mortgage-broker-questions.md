Not all mortgage brokers offer the same value, expertise, or lender access. Asking the right questions upfront ensures you partner with a broker who delivers competitive rates, transparent service, and expert guidance. Here are 10 essential questions every homebuyer should ask.

## 1. How Many Lenders Do You Work With?

**Why it matters**: More lender relationships mean more rate options. A broker with 10 lenders can't compete with one who has 40+.

**What to look for**: Minimum 20 lenders, including national banks, regional credit unions, and portfolio lenders. Ask for a list of their lending partners.

**Red flag**: Brokers who work with only 3-5 lenders offer limited competition and may steer you toward the lender paying the highest commission.

## 2. What Are Your Fees, and How Are You Compensated?

**Why it matters**: Transparency prevents surprise costs at closing. Understanding compensation structures reveals potential conflicts of interest.

**What to look for**: Clear disclosure of origination fees, processing fees, and lender-paid compensation. Reputable brokers explain exactly how they're paid.

**Good answer**: "Lenders pay me 1-1.5% of your loan amount. I don't charge you an origination fee beyond what's built into your rate quote. My compensation is the same regardless of which lender you choose."

## 3. Can You Show Me Rate Comparisons from Multiple Lenders?

**Why it matters**: This proves your broker is actually shopping your file—not just placing you with one preferred lender.

**What to look for**: Side-by-side rate sheets from at least 3-5 lenders, showing APR, monthly payment, closing costs, and lender credits.

**Red flag**: Brokers who present only one option without explaining why alternatives weren't competitive.

## 4. What Is Your Average Credit Score Range for Clients?

**Why it matters**: Brokers who specialize in high-credit borrowers may not have strong relationships with lenders who price competitively for 680-720 credit tiers.

**What to look for**: Experience across the credit spectrum (620-800). Ask about their success with borrowers similar to your [credit profile](https://www.middlecreditscore.com).

**Red flag**: Brokers who only work with 760+ credit scores may not secure the best rates if your score is lower.

## 5. How Long Does Your Typical Closing Take?

**Why it matters**: Timelines impact your offer competitiveness and planning. Delays can cost you your dream home or trigger rate lock extensions.

**What to look for**: Realistic timelines (21-45 days for conventional loans). Ask about their track record for on-time closings.

**Red flag**: Brokers promising "7-day closings" on conventional purchases rarely deliver unless you're paying all cash.

## 6. Do You Have Experience with My Loan Scenario?

**Why it matters**: Self-employed borrowers, investment property buyers, and borrowers with recent credit events need brokers with specialized lender relationships.

**What to look for**: Specific examples of successful closings similar to your situation. Ask how many self-employed (or similar) clients they've closed in the past year.

**Red flag**: Brokers who claim they can "handle anything" without demonstrating relevant experience.

## 7. What Happens If Rates Drop After I Lock?

**Why it matters**: Rate lock policies vary by lender. Some allow "float-down" provisions; others don't. Your broker should advocate for you.

**What to look for**: Clear explanation of rate lock terms, float-down options, and the broker's policy for re-shopping your loan if rates improve significantly.

**Good answer**: "I'll monitor rates daily. If rates drop 0.25% or more before closing, I'll renegotiate with your lender or re-shop your file to capture savings."

## 8. How Do You Handle Underwriting Issues?

**Why it matters**: Problems arise in 40%+ of mortgage transactions. Your broker's problem-solving ability determines whether you close on time.

**What to look for**: Specific examples of overcoming appraisal shortfalls, income documentation challenges, or title issues. Ask about their relationship with underwriters.

**Red flag**: Brokers who blame lenders, appraisers, or borrowers instead of taking ownership of solutions.

## 9. Will You Be My Main Point of Contact?

**Why it matters**: Some brokers hand off clients to junior processors after application. You want direct access to the decision-maker.

**What to look for**: Commitment to personal involvement throughout the process. Ask who handles your file day-to-day and who answers questions.

**Red flag**: Brokers who disappear after application, leaving you with rotating assistants who can't answer complex questions.

## 10. Can You Provide References from Recent Clients?

**Why it matters**: Past client experiences reveal responsiveness, accuracy, and professionalism. Online reviews can be fake; direct references are harder to manipulate.

**What to look for**: 2-3 recent client contacts (closed within 90 days) willing to share their experience. Ask about communication, problem-solving, and whether the broker delivered on promises.

**Red flag**: Brokers who refuse references or only offer testimonials from their website.

## Bonus Question: How Do You Stay Competitive on Rates?

**Why it matters**: Rate markets change daily. Brokers who check rate sheets once per week miss opportunities.

**What to look for**: Daily rate monitoring, relationships with wholesale lenders, and proactive communication about market movements.

**Good answer**: "I review rate sheets from all my lenders every morning. If I see better pricing for your scenario, I'll reach out immediately to discuss re-locking or switching lenders."

## Red Flags to Avoid

Walk away from brokers who:
- Pressure you to apply before explaining fees
- Refuse to provide written rate quotes
- Can't explain the difference between APR and interest rate
- Promise rates significantly lower than competitors without explanation
- Don't ask about your credit, income, or down payment before quoting rates
