Wyoming's mortgage rate landscape isn't uniform across the state. **Lender competition, property value concentration, and regional specialization create measurable rate differences** between Cheyenne, Casper, Jackson Hole, and rural counties.

## Regional Market Characteristics

### Cheyenne (Laramie County)

**Population**: ~65,000 (state capital, largest city)

**Lender Competition**: 
- 5–10 active local lenders (banks, credit unions)
- Multiple national lenders (Rocket, Better, LoanDepot)
- 3–5 broker offices with wholesale access

**Property Profile**:
- Median home price: ~$350K–$400K
- Strong conventional and FHA markets
- VA presence (F.E. Warren AFB military buyers)

**Rate Environment**: 
Most competitive statewide due to lender concentration. Brokers with wholesale access often beat local retail pricing by **0.125%–0.250%**.

---

### Casper (Natrona County)

**Population**: ~55,000 (second-largest city)

**Lender Competition**:
- 4–7 local lenders (regional banks, credit unions)
- National lenders active (online platforms)
- 2–4 broker offices

**Property Profile**:
- Median home price: ~$320K–$360K
- Energy sector employment influences buying patterns
- Conventional and FHA competitive

**Rate Environment**: 
Similar to Cheyenne but **1–2 fewer local lenders** creates slightly less competition. Wholesale broker access equalizes rates to Cheyenne levels.

---

### Jackson Hole (Teton County)

**Population**: ~23,000 (resort market concentration)

**Lender Competition**:
- 2–3 local banks (limited)
- **Specialized luxury/jumbo lenders** (national)
- Brokers with jumbo lender networks

**Property Profile**:
- Median home price: **$2.5M+** (luxury market)
- Most properties exceed $766,550 (jumbo threshold)
- Seasonal buyer demand (resort market)

**Rate Environment**: 
Jumbo loans typically **0.25%–0.50% higher** than conforming rates due to loan size. However, specialized luxury lenders offer better pricing than standard jumbo programs through Teton County market expertise.

**Critical Difference**: Standard Wyoming lenders often can't compete in Jackson Hole jumbo market. **Specialized jumbo lenders save 0.25%–0.50%** vs generic jumbo programs.

---

### Rural Counties (Sublette, Fremont, Carbon, etc.)

**Lender Competition**:
- 1–3 local banks (limited options)
- National lenders often decline rural/acreage properties
- **Broker wholesale access critical** for competitive pricing

**Property Profile**:
- Large acreage (20+ acres common)
- Working ranches with agricultural components
- Median prices: $280K–$350K (varies widely)

**Rate Environment**: 
Limited local competition creates **0.125%–0.375% rate disadvantage** vs Cheyenne/Casper without broker access. Portfolio lenders required for large acreage—may charge **0.25%–0.50% premium** for manual underwriting.

**USDA Exception**: Eligible rural counties offer **0% down USDA loans** with competitive rates (often better than FHA) for income-qualifying buyers.
