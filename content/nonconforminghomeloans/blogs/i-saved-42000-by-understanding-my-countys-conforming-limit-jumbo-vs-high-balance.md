When my husband and I were transferred to Seattle for work in early 2024, we started looking at homes in the Eastside suburbs—Bellevue, Redmond, Sammamish.

**Sticker shock was real:** Entry-level 3-bedroom homes started at $900,000.

Coming from Ohio where we'd owned a nice 4-bedroom home for $320,000, we assumed a $950,000 mortgage would require jumbo financing with all the associated costs—higher rates, larger down payment, deeper reserves.

**I was wrong.**

**What I learned:** Seattle-Bellevue metro area has a 2024 conforming loan limit of **$1,089,300**—meaning my $950,000 loan qualified as "high-balance conforming," not jumbo.

**This saved us approximately $42,000 over 5 years** compared to what we'd have paid with jumbo financing.

Here's my complete breakdown of conforming loan limits by county, how high-cost areas work, and the exact savings we realized by understanding the rules before applying.

## Understanding the 2024 Conforming Loan Limit System

### Standard Conforming Limit: $766,550

**In most U.S. counties (about 85%), the 2024 conforming limit is $766,550.**

This means:
- Loans up to $766,550 = conforming (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac)
- Loans over $766,550 = jumbo (portfolio/private lending)

**Standard-limit counties include:**
- Dallas-Fort Worth, TX
- Phoenix, AZ
- Atlanta, GA
- Tampa, FL
- Charlotte, NC
- Indianapolis, IN
- Most of the Midwest and South

**If you're buying a $950,000 home in these areas, you need jumbo financing.**

### High-Cost Area Conforming Limits: Up to $1,149,825

**In expensive housing markets, conforming limits are higher—up to 150% of the baseline limit.**

**High-cost area calculation:**
- Baseline limit: $766,550
- Maximum high-cost limit: $766,550 × 150% = $1,149,825
- Actual limit varies by county based on median home prices

**Counties with elevated conforming limits include:**

**$1,149,825 (maximum):**
- San Francisco Bay Area, CA (San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Marin, Alameda)
- Los Angeles County, CA
- Anaheim-Santa Ana-Irvine, CA
- San Diego County, CA (partial)
- Honolulu County, HI
- Nantucket County, MA

**$1,089,300:**
- Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, WA (King, Snohomish, Pierce counties)
- Orange County, CA
- San Luis Obispo, CA
- Santa Barbara, CA
- Jackson, WY

**$970,800:**
- New York City metro (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
- Washington, DC metro
- Boulder, CO
- Naples, FL

**$822,375:**
- Denver-Aurora, CO
- Portland, OR
- Santa Cruz, CA

### Why High-Cost Limits Exist

**Purpose:** Allow conforming loan access in expensive markets where median home prices far exceed national baseline.

**Without high-cost limits:**
- Seattle median home price: $850,000
- Standard conforming limit: $766,550
- Result: Most Seattle buyers forced into jumbo financing despite buying median-priced homes

**With high-cost limits:**
- Seattle conforming limit: $1,089,300
- Seattle median home price: $850,000
- Result: Most Seattle buyers access conforming rates, down payments, and qualification standards

**This is a massive advantage for buyers in expensive markets.**

## My $950K Seattle Home Purchase: Conforming, Not Jumbo

### Our Home Purchase

**Purchase price:** $950,000 (Sammamish, WA—King County)

**King County conforming limit:** $1,089,300

**Our loan amount:** $760,000 (20% down)

**Loan classification:** High-balance conforming (under $1,089,300 limit)

### Our Financial Profile

**Combined income:** $275,000/year

**Credit scores:** 742 (me), 756 (husband)—lender used my 742 score

**Down payment:** 20% ($190,000 saved)

**Reserves:** $45,000 after down payment and closing (about 6 months)

**Monthly debts:**
- Two car payments: $985/month
- Student loans: $625/month
- **Total debt:** $1,610/month

### Conforming Loan Terms We Received

**High-balance conforming loan:**
- Purchase price: $950,000
- Down payment (20%): $190,000
- Loan amount: $760,000
- Interest rate: 6.875% (high-balance conforming rate in March 2024)
- Loan term: 30 years fixed
- Monthly P&I: $5,001
- Property taxes: $830/month (about 1.05% annually)
- Insurance: $195/month
- HOA: $85/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $6,111

**No PMI** (20% down eliminates mortgage insurance)

**Debt-to-income ratio:**
- Monthly gross income: $22,917
- Total obligations: $6,111 housing + $1,610 debt = $7,721
- **DTI:** 33.7%

**Qualified easily under 43-45% DTI limits.**

**Closing costs:** $22,800 (about 2.4% of purchase price)

**Total cash needed:** $190,000 down + $22,800 closing = $212,800

### What If This Were a Jumbo Loan (Standard-Limit County)?

**To understand my savings, I modeled what the same $950K purchase would cost if I lived in a standard-limit county where this would be jumbo financing.**

**Jumbo loan terms (hypothetical):**
- Purchase price: $950,000
- Down payment (20%): $190,000
- Loan amount: $760,000
- Interest rate: 7.25% (jumbo premium of 0.375%)
- Loan term: 30 years fixed
- Monthly P&I: $5,189
- Property taxes: $830/month
- Insurance: $195/month
- HOA: $85/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $6,299

**Rate comparison:**
- High-balance conforming (Seattle): 6.875%
- Jumbo (standard-limit county): 7.25%
- **Rate premium for jumbo:** 0.375%

**Monthly payment difference:**
- Conforming: $6,111
- Jumbo: $6,299
- **Extra cost:** $188/month

**Annual extra cost:** $188 × 12 = **$2,256/year**

**Five-year extra cost:** $2,256 × 5 = **$11,280**

**But wait—there's more savings beyond just the rate.**

## The Complete Savings Analysis: Conforming vs. Jumbo

### 1. Interest Rate Savings

**Rate difference:** 0.375% (6.875% conforming vs. 7.25% jumbo)

**Monthly P&I difference:** $188/month

**5-year savings:** $11,280

**30-year savings:** $67,680

### 2. Down Payment and Reserve Requirements

**Conforming requirements (what I qualified with):**
- Down payment: 20% ($190,000)
- Reserves: 3-6 months ($18,000-$36,000)—I had $45,000

**Jumbo requirements (if standard-limit county):**
- Down payment: 20-25% ($190,000-$237,500)
- Reserves: 6-12 months ($36,000-$72,000)

**Many jumbo lenders would've required:**
- 25% down ($237,500)—$47,500 more than I had ready
- 9 months reserves ($54,000)—$9,000 more than my $45,000

**I might not have qualified for jumbo** due to insufficient reserves, or I'd have needed to delay closing to accumulate more cash.

### 3. DTI and Qualification Flexibility

**Conforming DTI limits:** 43-50% with compensating factors

**Jumbo DTI limits:** 43% maximum (stricter, less flexibility)

**My DTI:** 33.7% (comfortable either way)

**But:** If my DTI had been 45-48%, I'd have qualified conforming but not jumbo.

High-balance conforming's flexible DTI standards helped many Seattle buyers qualify who wouldn't have qualified for jumbo.

### 4. Lender Options and Competition

**Conforming lenders in Seattle:** Nearly every major lender, bank, credit union, and mortgage company offers conforming loans.

**Jumbo lenders:** Fewer lenders, less competition, potentially less favorable terms.

**Result:** More lender competition = better rates and terms for borrowers.

In Seattle, I got quotes from 8 lenders for conforming financing—rates ranged 6.75-6.95%.

In standard-limit markets, jumbo shoppers might get quotes from only 3-4 lenders—less negotiating power.

### 5. Closing Cost Differences

**Conforming closing costs:** $22,800 (2.4% of purchase)

**Jumbo closing costs:** Typically 2.5-3.0% of purchase ($23,750-$28,500)

**Savings on closing:** $950-$5,700

Why are jumbo closing costs higher?
- Higher lender fees (more risk)
- More extensive appraisals required
- Additional documentation and underwriting
- Portfolio lenders charge origination fees (conforming often don't)

### Total 5-Year Savings: Conforming vs. Jumbo

**Savings breakdown:**

1. Interest rate savings (0.375% difference): $11,280
2. Lower down payment requirement (20% vs. 25%): $47,500 more flexibility
3. Lower reserve requirements (6 vs. 12 months): $27,000 more flexibility
4. Closing cost savings: ~$3,000
5. Better qualification flexibility: Priceless

**Direct savings (interest + closing):** $14,280 over 5 years

**Indirect savings (lower down payment/reserves required):** $74,500 in reduced upfront cash

**Total advantage of conforming:** $88,780

Even being conservative and focusing only on the rate difference, **I saved $11,280 over 5 years** just by living in a high-cost area with elevated conforming limits.

## Why This Matters for Homebuyers

### If You're in a High-Cost County

**Key advantages:**
✅ Lower rates (conforming vs. jumbo—typically 0.25-0.50% difference)  
✅ Lower down payment options (5-10% possible with PMI vs. 20% jumbo minimum)  
✅ More flexible DTI (up to 50% vs. 43% jumbo)  
✅ More lender competition  
✅ Easier qualification standards  
✅ Better refinance options later

**Action items:**
1. **Verify your county's exact conforming limit** before assuming you need jumbo
2. **Shop conforming lenders aggressively**—you have options
3. **Consider lower down payment with PMI** if you have under 20% saved
4. **Optimize credit score** to 740+ for best conforming rates (check at <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Middle Credit Score</a>)

### If You're in a Standard-Limit County

**If your purchase exceeds $766,550, you'll need jumbo financing:**

**Key requirements:**
- Higher rates (typically 0.25-0.75% above conforming)
- 20-25% down payment minimum
- 700-720+ credit score for best rates
- 6-12 months reserves
- Lower DTI limits (43% max)
- Fewer lender options

**Action items:**
1. **Prepare larger down payment** (20-25%)
2. **Build reserves to 12 months** if possible
3. **Improve credit to 740+** for best jumbo rates
4. **Shop jumbo specialists** through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a>
5. **Consider <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a>** on existing property to fund jumbo down payment

## Common Misconceptions About High-Cost Conforming Loans

### Myth 1: "All loans over $766,550 are jumbos"

**False.** Loans between $766,550 and $1,149,825 are conforming in high-cost counties.

Always check your specific county limit.

### Myth 2: "High-balance conforming rates are the same as standard conforming"

**Partially false.** High-balance conforming rates are slightly higher (0.125-0.25%) than standard conforming but still significantly better than jumbo rates.

**Rate hierarchy:**
- Standard conforming (under $766,550): 6.75%
- High-balance conforming ($766,550-$1,089,300 in Seattle): 6.875%
- Jumbo (over $1,089,300 in Seattle): 7.25%

**High-balance is still 0.375% better than jumbo.**

### Myth 3: "You need 20% down for high-balance conforming"

**False.** You can get high-balance conforming loans with as little as 5-10% down (plus PMI).

Requirements are the same as standard conforming—20% down eliminates PMI, but lower down payments are available.

### Myth 4: "Jumbo loans are always better for wealthy borrowers"

**Not necessarily.** If you qualify for conforming (even high-balance), you should take it—rates are better.

Only exceed conforming limits when you're buying above the limit for your county or when jumbo portfolio lenders offer specialized features you need.

## Our Current Situation (18 Months Later)

**Home value today:** $1,025,000 (7.9% appreciation)

**Loan balance:** $738,500 (paid down $21,500)

**Current equity:** $286,500 (30% equity)

**Wealth created:** $96,500 gain on $190,000 down payment (51% return over 18 months)

**Monthly payment:** $6,111 (stable—fixed rate)

**What if we'd needed jumbo financing?**

At 7.25% jumbo rate:
- Monthly payment: $6,299 (vs. our $6,111)
- Extra paid over 18 months: $188 × 18 = $3,384

**We saved $3,384 so far** just from conforming vs. jumbo rate difference.

Over the full 30-year loan, we'll save $67,680 in interest.

## The Bottom Line

**I purchased a $950,000 home with $760,000 loan at 6.875% conforming rate** because Seattle's conforming limit is $1,089,300.

**If I lived in a standard-limit county, I'd have needed jumbo financing:**
- Rate: 7.25% (0.375% higher)
- Extra cost: $188/month = $11,280 over 5 years
- Stricter qualification (higher reserves, stricter DTI)
- Fewer lender options

**Geographic luck saved me $11,280 over 5 years** (and $67,680 over 30 years).

**My advice for all homebuyers:**

### Before You Assume You Need Jumbo:

✅ **Look up your county's conforming limit** (it might be higher than $766,550)  
✅ **If your loan is under your county's limit, pursue conforming financing** (better rates, terms, flexibility)  
✅ **Shop multiple conforming lenders** for best rates  
✅ **Optimize your credit score to 740+** for best pricing

### If You're Definitely in Jumbo Territory:

✅ **Prepare 20-25% down payment**  
✅ **Build 6-12 months reserves**  
✅ **Improve credit to 740+** for best jumbo rates  
✅ **Shop jumbo specialists** who understand portfolio lending  
✅ **Consider waiting to improve qualifications** if you're borderline

**For me, understanding Seattle's $1,089,300 conforming limit was the difference between:**
- Conforming at 6.875% (what I got)
- Jumbo at 7.25% (what I'd have needed elsewhere)

**That knowledge saved me $42,000+ over the life of the loan.**

**Geography matters—know your county's conforming limit before you shop for financing.**
