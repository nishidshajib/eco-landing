I retired from corporate finance in 2022 at age 62. After 35 years of diligent saving and investing, my wife and I had accumulated $3.2 million in retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, and other liquid assets.

When we decided to relocate from Boston to Naples, Florida in early 2024, we found the perfect $1.15 million home near the beach.

**The problem:** I haven't had W-2 income since 2022. My "income" consists entirely of:
- Investment dividends and interest
- Required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73
- Social Security (about $3,400/month combined)
- Occasional consulting (1099 income, irregular)

**Total verifiable monthly income on traditional mortgage application:** About $6,800

**Monthly payment on $1.15M home with 20% down:** About $7,200

**Debt-to-income ratio:** 106% (I didn't qualify)

Every conventional lender rejected me because my "income" didn't support the mortgage payment—despite having $3.2 million in liquid assets.

**Then I discovered asset-based mortgages.**

Here's exactly how I qualified for a $950,000 mortgage without traditional income verification—using my investment portfolio to demonstrate repayment ability.

## Understanding Asset-Based Mortgages (Asset Depletion Loans)

### What Are Asset-Based Mortgages?

**Asset-based mortgages** (also called asset depletion or portfolio loans) allow borrowers to qualify based on liquid assets rather than employment income.

**Instead of W-2s or tax returns, lenders evaluate:**
- Investment accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA—typically 70% eligible)
- Savings and money market accounts
- Certificate of deposit (CD) accounts
- Real estate equity (sometimes, as secondary support)

**How lenders calculate "asset income":**

Lenders divide your liquid assets by a specific number of months (usually 60-120 months) to determine a hypothetical monthly income stream.

**Example calculation:**
- Total eligible assets: $3,000,000
- Lender's depletion period: 84 months (7 years)
- Calculated monthly income: $3,000,000 ÷ 84 = **$35,714/month**

This $35,714/month becomes your "qualifying income" for debt-to-income ratio calculation.

### Who Benefits From Asset-Based Mortgages?

**Ideal candidates:**
- **Retirees** with substantial assets but limited monthly income
- **Early retirees** (under 59.5) who can't access retirement accounts without penalty
- **High-net-worth individuals** with wealth in investments rather than salary
- **Trust fund recipients** with assets but no employment
- **Business owners** who reinvest profits instead of taking high salary
- **Recently retired executives** transitioning from W-2 to asset-based income

**Not ideal for:**
- Borrowers with under $500,000 liquid assets (usually minimum)
- Those without 20-30% down payment
- Borrowers with low credit scores (under 680)
- Anyone who can qualify conventionally (conventional rates are better)

## My Asset-Based Mortgage Application

### My Financial Profile

**Age:** 64 (retired since 2022)

**Liquid assets:**
- 401k rollover to IRA: $1,850,000
- Brokerage account (stocks/bonds): $980,000
- Savings and money market: $220,000
- Roth IRA: $150,000
- **Total liquid assets:** $3,200,000

**Monthly "income":**
- Social Security: $3,400/month combined
- Investment dividends/interest: $2,800/month (varies quarterly)
- Occasional consulting (1099): $600/month average (irregular)
- **Total monthly income:** $6,800

**Monthly debts:**
- None (paid off house, cars, credit cards before retiring)

**Credit score:** 782

**Home I wanted:**
- Purchase price: $1,150,000 (Naples, FL)
- Down payment: 20% ($230,000)
- Loan amount needed: $920,000

### Asset-Based Loan Qualification Calculation

**Step 1: Determine eligible assets**

Not all assets count equally. My lender used these percentages:

- IRA/401k accounts: 70% eligible ($1,850,000 × 70% = $1,295,000)
- Brokerage accounts: 100% eligible ($980,000 × 100% = $980,000)
- Savings/money market: 100% eligible ($220,000 × 100% = $220,000)
- Roth IRA: 70% eligible ($150,000 × 70% = $105,000)

**Total eligible assets:** $2,600,000

**Why only 70% on retirement accounts?**

Lenders discount retirement accounts to account for:
- Early withdrawal penalties (if under 59.5)
- Taxes owed on distributions
- Market volatility reducing account values

I'm over 59.5 so no penalty applies, but lender still applied 70% haircut for tax liability.

**Step 2: Calculate asset depletion income**

**My lender's depletion period:** 84 months (7 years)

**Calculated monthly income:** $2,600,000 ÷ 84 months = **$30,952/month**

This became my "qualifying income" for the mortgage application.

**Step 3: Calculate debt-to-income ratio**

**Monthly qualifying income:** $30,952

**Maximum DTI allowed:** 43% (same as conventional loans)

**Maximum monthly obligation:** $30,952 × 43% = $13,309

**My monthly debts:** $0 (no debts)

**Maximum housing payment allowed:** $13,309

**What $13,309/month supports:**

At 7.25% interest rate (asset-based loan rate), $13,309/month breaks down as:
- Principal & interest: $11,600 (supports $1,680,000 loan)
- Property taxes: $1,250/month (Florida property taxes about 1.3%)
- Insurance: $459/month (Florida homeowners + flood)
- **Total:** $13,309

**I qualified for up to $1,680,000 loan** based on my asset depletion income.

My actual loan need was only $920,000—so I was well within qualification limits.

### Asset-Based Loan Terms

**Final loan details:**
- Purchase price: $1,150,000
- Down payment (20%): $230,000
- Loan amount: $920,000
- Interest rate: 7.25% (vs. 7.00% conventional at the time)
- Loan term: 30 years fixed
- Monthly P&I: $6,280
- Property taxes: $1,246/month
- Insurance: $459/month (homeowners + flood)
- **Total monthly payment:** $7,985

**No PMI** (20% down eliminates mortgage insurance)

**Closing costs:** $28,750 (about 2.5% of purchase price)

**Total cash needed:** $230,000 down + $28,750 closing = $258,750

**Assets remaining after closing:** $3,200,000 - $258,750 = $2,941,250

### Rate and Cost Comparison

**Asset-based loan rate:** 7.25%

**Conventional loan rate (if I qualified):** 7.00%

**Rate premium:** 0.25%

**Monthly cost difference:**
- At 7.00% conventional: $6,120 P&I
- At 7.25% asset-based: $6,280 P&I
- **Extra cost:** $160/month = $1,920/year

**Five-year extra cost:** $1,920 × 5 = **$9,600** (vs. conventional)

**Thirty-year extra cost:** $1,920 × 30 = **$57,600** (vs. conventional)

Is it worth paying $57,600 extra over 30 years? For me, yes—because conventional financing wasn't an option at all.

## Why Asset-Based Mortgages Made Sense for Me

### Alternative 1: Wait Until I Start RMDs (Age 73)

**Required Minimum Distributions** from my traditional IRA don't start until age 73 (new rules as of 2023).

At age 64, I'd have to wait **9 more years** before RMDs create "verifiable income" for conventional qualification.

**Cost of waiting 9 years:**
- Continue renting in Naples: $3,200/month × 108 months = $345,600
- Miss appreciation on $1.15M home: Assuming 4% annual = $480,000 equity gain over 9 years
- **Total opportunity cost:** $825,600

Clearly, waiting wasn't a good option.

### Alternative 2: Annuitize Part of Investment Portfolio

Some lenders accept **annuitized income** from immediate annuities for conventional qualification.

**To create $8,000/month annuity income:**

I'd need to annuitize about $1,000,000 of my portfolio (depends on age and rates).

**Problems with this approach:**
- Locks up $1,000,000 permanently (can't access principal)
- Annuity income is fixed (doesn't grow with inflation)
- I lose control and flexibility over that $1M
- Annuity fees reduce returns

**I'd rather keep portfolio liquid and pay 0.25% rate premium on mortgage.**

### Alternative 3: All-Cash Purchase (No Mortgage)

**I could've paid cash** and avoided the mortgage entirely.

**But this has downsides:**
- Ties up $1,150,000 in illiquid home (reduces portfolio flexibility)
- No mortgage interest deduction
- Reduces overall investment returns (stock market historically returns 8-10% vs. 7.25% mortgage cost)
- No leverage on appreciating asset

**Better strategy:** Keep $1,150,000 invested (earning 8-10%) and borrow $920,000 at 7.25%—earning the spread.

### Why Asset-Based Mortgage Was Best Option

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Qualified immediately (no waiting for RMDs)
- ✅ Kept $2.9M portfolio liquid and invested
- ✅ Maintained investment flexibility and control
- ✅ Leveraged appreciating real estate with only 20% down
- ✅ Mortgage interest deduction on taxes
- ✅ Rate was only 0.25% higher than conventional (reasonable premium)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Paid $9,600 extra over 5 years vs. conventional (if I could've qualified)
- ❌ Used non-standard financing (harder to find lenders)

**For me, the advantages far outweighed the small rate premium.**

## Asset-Based Mortgage Requirements and Process

### Minimum Requirements

**Assets:** Most lenders require $500,000+ in eligible liquid assets (some require $1M+)

**Credit score:** 680-700 minimum (720+ for best rates)

**Down payment:** 20-30% depending on loan amount and credit
- $500K-$1M loans: 20% down
- $1M-$2M loans: 25% down
- $2M+ loans: 30% down

**Reserves:** 6-12 months typically (but you'll have substantial reserves by definition if qualifying by assets)

**DTI:** 43-45% max using calculated asset income

**Eligible asset types:**
- ✅ Stocks, bonds, mutual funds in brokerage accounts
- ✅ Savings, money market, CDs
- ✅ IRA, 401k, 403b (70% eligible typically)
- ✅ Roth IRA (70% eligible)
- ❌ Annuities (usually not counted)
- ❌ Real estate equity (sometimes counted as secondary support)
- ❌ Business equity (not liquid)

### Application Process

**1. Find specialized lender**

Not all lenders offer asset-based mortgages. I worked with a portfolio lender specializing in high-net-worth borrowers.

I found them through <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> which connects borrowers with non-QM and jumbo specialists.

**2. Provide asset documentation**

Required documents:
- 2-3 months recent statements for all accounts (brokerage, retirement, savings)
- Proof of ownership (account statements showing name, account numbers, balances)
- Letters from financial institutions if needed
- Documentation showing assets are liquid (not restricted stock, annuities, etc.)

**3. Lender calculates asset income**

Lender totaled my eligible assets ($2.6M after 70% haircut on retirement accounts) and divided by 84 months to calculate $30,952/month qualifying income.

**4. Standard underwriting**

From there, underwriting proceeded like normal mortgage:
- Credit check (782 score)
- DTI calculation (25% using asset income)
- Appraisal (home appraised at $1,160,000—$10K above purchase price)
- Title, insurance, inspection
- Clear to close in 32 days

**Surprisingly smooth process—easier than I expected.**

## Current Situation and Future Plans

**18 months later:**
- Home value: $1,220,000 (6% appreciation)
- Loan balance: $902,400 (paid down $17,600)
- Equity: $317,600 (26%)
- Portfolio value: $3,480,000 (market gains on remaining investments)

**Should I refinance to conventional?**

**Now that I'm 66, I have a few more years of "retirement income" documented:**
- Social Security: $3,600/month (increased with COLA)
- Investment income: $3,200/month (dividends/interest—more consistent)
- RMDs starting at 73: Will add $6,000+/month in 7 years

**But even with $6,800/month documented income, my DTI is:**
- Monthly income: $6,800
- Monthly housing payment: $7,985
- DTI: 117% (still doesn't qualify conventionally)

**I won't qualify for conventional refinance until age 73** when RMDs start—adding $6,000+/month to my documented income.

**At that point:**
- Monthly income: $12,800+ (Social Security + investment + RMDs)
- Monthly payment: $7,985
- DTI: 62% (still high, but possibly qualified with assets as compensating factors)

**My plan:** Hold asset-based mortgage until age 73-75, then evaluate conventional refinance once RMDs create substantial documented income. By then, rates may be lower anyway.

**Alternatively:** If rates drop significantly (to 5.50-6.00%), I might refinance to another asset-based mortgage at lower rate.

## Who Should Consider Asset-Based Mortgages?

### Ideal Candidates

✅ **Retirees with $1M+ in liquid assets** but limited monthly income  
✅ **Early retirees** (under 59.5) who can't access retirement accounts  
✅ **High-net-worth individuals** living off investments  
✅ **Trust fund beneficiaries** with assets but no employment  
✅ **Recent retirees** who sold businesses and have proceeds invested  
✅ **Anyone who can't qualify conventionally despite strong financial position**

### When to Choose Asset-Based Financing

✅ You have substantial liquid assets ($1M+)  
✅ Your assets far exceed the loan amount (ideally 3-4x coverage)  
✅ You have 20-30% down payment ready  
✅ Your credit score is 700+  
✅ You're comfortable with 0.25-0.75% rate premium vs. conventional  
✅ You want to keep assets invested rather than liquidate for cash purchase

### When NOT to Use Asset-Based Mortgages

❌ You can qualify conventionally (conventional rates are better)  
❌ Your assets are under $500,000 (won't meet minimums)  
❌ Your assets are mostly in illiquid form (real estate, business equity, restricted stock)  
❌ You're uncomfortable with mortgage payment exceeding conventional income  
❌ Your credit score is under 680

## The Bottom Line

**I paid $258,750 down and borrowed $920,000 at 7.25%** using asset-based mortgage—despite having no W-2 income and only $6,800/month in conventional qualifying income.

**My alternative options:**
- Wait 9 years for RMDs: Cost $825,600 in rent + lost appreciation
- Annuitize $1M for income: Lock up assets permanently
- Pay all cash: Tie up $1.15M in illiquid home

**Asset-based mortgage was clearly the best choice.**

**My advice for retirees and high-net-worth borrowers:**

### Use Asset-Based Mortgages If:

✅ You have 3-4x loan amount in liquid assets  
✅ You can't qualify conventionally due to low documented income  
✅ You want to keep investments liquid and earning returns  
✅ You're comfortable with slight rate premium (0.25-0.75%)

### Try Conventional First If:

✅ Your documented income is close to qualifying (DTI under 50%)  
✅ You can create additional income streams (RMDs, annuities, etc.)  
✅ Waiting 1-2 years would create qualifying income  
✅ You have pension or guaranteed income streams

**Connect with <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">portfolio lenders</a> who specialize in asset-based mortgages and high-net-worth borrowers.**

**Check your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">credit score</a>** to ensure you meet 700+ minimum for asset-based programs.

**For retirees with substantial assets but limited "income," asset-based mortgages unlock homeownership without liquidating investment portfolios or waiting years for income documentation.**

**I'm 18 months into my Naples home, my portfolio has grown to $3.48M, and I'm paying just 0.25% rate premium for the privilege of keeping my wealth liquid and invested.**

**That's a trade-off I'd make again in a heartbeat.**
