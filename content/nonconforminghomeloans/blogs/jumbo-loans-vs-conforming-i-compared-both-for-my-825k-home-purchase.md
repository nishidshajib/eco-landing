When I started house hunting in Orange County, California in early 2024, I quickly learned that $825,000 was the baseline for single-family homes in decent neighborhoods.

**My first question:** Is that a jumbo loan or conforming loan?

**The answer:** In Orange County, the 2024 conforming loan limit is $1,089,300—so my $825,000 purchase qualified as conforming, not jumbo.

## Understanding the 2024 Conforming Loan Limits

### Standard vs. High-Cost Area Limits

**Standard conforming limit (2024):** $766,550 in most U.S. counties

**High-cost area conforming limit (2024):** Up to $1,149,825 in the most expensive counties

**How high-cost limits are calculated:** 150% of the standard conforming limit in expensive markets where median home prices exceed baseline by significant margins.

**Counties with higher conforming limits include:**
- Los Angeles County, CA: $1,149,825
- Orange County, CA: $1,089,300
- San Francisco Bay Area, CA: $1,149,825
- New York City area, NY: $970,800
- Washington, DC area: $970,800
- Seattle-Bellevue, WA: $1,089,300
- Denver, CO: $822,375
- Plus many others

**Why this matters:** A $900,000 loan is conforming in Orange County (saves 0.25-0.50% on rate) but jumbo in Dallas (pays 0.25-0.50% premium).

### What "Conforming" Actually Means

**Conforming loans:**
- Follow Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines
- Can be purchased by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
- Lenders have less risk because they can sell loans to Fannie/Freddie
- Therefore: Lower rates for borrowers

**Non-conforming (jumbo) loans:**
- Exceed Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac loan limits
- Cannot be sold to GSEs
- Lenders must hold loans in portfolio or sell to private investors
- Higher risk for lenders
- Therefore: Higher rates for borrowers (typically 0.25-0.75% premium)

## My $825K Home Purchase: Conforming Loan in High-Cost Orange County

### My Qualifications

**Purchase price:** $825,000 (Orange County, CA)

**Loan type:** High-balance conforming (under $1,089,300 Orange County limit)

**My financial profile:**
- Income: $165,000/year ($13,750/month gross)
- Credit score: 732 (middle score)
- Down payment: 10% ($82,500)
- Savings after down payment: $35,000 (about 5 months reserves)
- Debt: $780/month (car payment $420, student loan $285, credit cards $75)

### Conforming Loan Terms I Received

**Loan details:**
- Purchase price: $825,000
- Down payment (10%): $82,500
- Loan amount: $742,500 (under conforming limit)
- Interest rate: 7.00%
- Loan term: 30 years fixed
- Monthly P&I: $4,940
- PMI: $310/month (0.50% annually on loan amount, drops at 80% LTV)
- Property taxes: $720/month
- Insurance: $165/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $6,135

**Debt-to-income ratio:**
- Monthly gross income: $13,750
- Total monthly obligations: $6,135 housing + $780 debt = $6,915
- **DTI:** 50.3%

**Wait, 50% DTI? How did I qualify?**

High-balance conforming loans (between $766,550 and $1,089,300) allow up to 50% DTI with compensating factors:
- Credit score 720+ (I had 732)
- 3+ months reserves (I had 5 months)
- Stable 3+ year employment (I had 4 years same employer)
- Low down payment (10%) offset by strong credit and reserves

### What If I'd Needed a Jumbo Loan Instead?

**To understand jumbo loan costs, I modeled the same scenario if I lived in a state with standard $766,550 conforming limit.**

**Hypothetical jumbo loan for $825K home in standard-limit county:**
- Purchase price: $825,000
- Down payment (15% required for jumbo): $123,750
- Loan amount: $701,250
- Interest rate: 7.375% (jumbo premium of 0.375%)
- Monthly P&I: $4,861
- No PMI (jumbo loans with 15%+ down don't require PMI)
- Property taxes: $720/month
- Insurance: $165/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $5,746

**Comparing conforming vs. jumbo:**

| Feature | My Conforming (OC) | Jumbo (Standard Limit) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Down payment | 10% ($82,500) | 15% ($123,750) |
| Extra down needed | — | $41,250 more |
| Interest rate | 7.00% | 7.375% |
| Monthly P&I | $4,940 | $4,861 |
| PMI | $310/month | $0 |
| Total payment | $6,135 | $5,746 |
| Reserves required | 3-6 months | 6-12 months |

**Key insights:**

1. **Jumbo required $41,250 more down payment** (15% vs. 10%)—money I didn't have
2. **Jumbo had no PMI** but higher rate offset savings
3. **Jumbo had lower total payment** ($5,746 vs. $6,135) due to smaller loan amount
4. **Jumbo required deeper reserves** (6-12 months vs. 3-6 months)—I had only 5 months

**Bottom line:** Even though jumbo monthly payment was lower, I couldn't qualify because:
- I didn't have $123,750 for 15% down (only had $82,500)
- I didn't have 6-12 months reserves (only had 5 months, barely met conforming minimum)

**Being in high-cost Orange County saved me—I qualified as conforming with 10% down.**

## Rate Comparison: Conforming vs. Jumbo at Different Price Points

### Scenario 1: $700,000 Purchase (Under Standard Conforming Limit)

**Conforming loan (available everywhere):**
- Down payment (5%): $35,000
- Loan amount: $665,000
- Rate: 6.875%
- Monthly P&I: $4,371
- PMI: $277/month (0.50% annually)
- **Total P&I + PMI:** $4,648

**Analysis:** This is conforming nationwide. Best rates, low down payment, accessible to most qualified buyers with 620+ credit.

### Scenario 2: $825,000 Purchase

**Option A: High-cost county (Orange County, Seattle, etc.)—CONFORMING**
- Down payment (10%): $82,500
- Loan amount: $742,500
- Rate: 7.00%
- Monthly P&I: $4,940
- PMI: $310/month
- **Total P&I + PMI:** $5,250

**Option B: Standard-limit county (Dallas, Phoenix, etc.)—JUMBO**
- Down payment (15%): $123,750
- Loan amount: $701,250
- Rate: 7.375%
- Monthly P&I: $4,861
- PMI: $0
- **Total P&I + PMI:** $4,861

**Difference:** High-cost conforming costs $389/month more but requires $41,250 less down payment.

**Break-even:** $41,250 ÷ $389/month = 106 months (8.8 years) to break even on the extra down payment.

### Scenario 3: $1.2M Purchase

**Option A: High-cost county (LA, SF, NYC)—CONFORMING**
- Down payment (15%): $180,000
- Loan amount: $1,020,000 (under $1,149,825 limit in LA/SF)
- Rate: 7.125%
- Monthly P&I: $6,919
- PMI: $425/month (0.50% annually on conforming)
- **Total P&I + PMI:** $7,344

**Option B: Standard-limit county—JUMBO**
- Down payment (20%): $240,000
- Loan amount: $960,000
- Rate: 7.375%
- Monthly P&I: $6,657
- PMI: $0
- **Total P&I + PMI:** $6,657

**Difference:** High-cost conforming costs $687/month more but requires $60,000 less down payment.

**Break-even:** $60,000 ÷ $687/month = 87 months (7.3 years)

### Scenario 4: $2M+ Purchase (Jumbo Everywhere)

**No conforming option available—jumbo required nationwide:**
- Down payment (20%): $400,000+
- Loan amount: $1,600,000+
- Rate: 7.25-7.50%
- Monthly P&I: $10,900+
- PMI: $0
- Reserves: 12 months minimum ($160,000+ liquid after closing)

**At this price point, loan limits don't matter—you're in jumbo territory everywhere.**

## High-Balance Conforming: The Sweet Spot or Trap?

### Benefits of High-Balance Conforming

**1. Lower down payment requirements**

I qualified with 10% down ($82,500) vs. 15-20% required for jumbo ($123,750-$165,000).

**2. Lower credit score requirements**

High-balance conforming accepts 620-640+ credit (depending on down payment and compensating factors) vs. 700-720+ for jumbo.

**3. Higher DTI allowances**

I qualified at 50.3% DTI due to strong compensating factors—jumbo lenders typically cap at 43-45% DTI.

**4. More lender options**

Most conventional lenders offer high-balance conforming—but fewer lenders offer true jumbo products.

**5. Lower rates than jumbo**

7.00% conforming vs. 7.375% jumbo in my scenario—0.375% savings.

### Downsides of High-Balance Conforming

**1. PMI required under 20% down**

I'm paying $310/month PMI ($3,720/year) until I hit 80% LTV.

**2. Rates higher than standard conforming**

High-balance conforming (7.00%) was 0.125% higher than standard conforming loans under $766,550 (6.875%).

**3. Stricter scrutiny than standard conforming**

Underwriters treated my high-balance conforming loan almost like jumbo—requiring extensive documentation, verification, and reserves.

**4. Limited to expensive markets**

If I moved to Dallas or Phoenix, I'd need to refinance to jumbo (wouldn't transfer as conforming).

## My PMI Elimination Strategy

**Current situation:**
- Home value: $825,000 (original purchase)
- Loan balance: $742,500 (original)
- Current LTV: 90%
- PMI: $310/month ($3,720/year)

**PMI drops automatically when I hit 78% LTV** (pay down to $643,500 balance or home appreciates to $952,564).

**Option 1: Wait for appreciation**

If my home appreciates 4% annually, it'll be worth $970,000 in 4 years.

At $970,000 value with $710,000 balance (after 4 years paydown), my LTV = 73.2%—PMI drops automatically.

**Cost of waiting:** $310 × 48 months = **$14,880 PMI paid over 4 years**

**Option 2: Prepay principal to 78% LTV**

To hit 78% LTV immediately, I'd need to pay down loan to $643,500 (78% of $825,000).

Required principal prepayment: $742,500 - $643,500 = $99,000

I don't have $99,000 to prepay, so this isn't realistic.

**Option 3: Request PMI removal at 80% LTV after appreciation + paydown**

Once home appreciates to $875,000 (6% increase over 2 years) and loan pays down to $722,000, my LTV = 82.5%.

I can pay extra $20,000 to get to 80% LTV ($700,000 balance) and request PMI removal.

**Cost:** 2 years PMI ($310 × 24 = $7,440) + $20,000 prepayment

**Savings:** Eliminate PMI 2 years early (save $7,440)

**My plan:** Wait 2 years for appreciation to $875,000, prepay $20,000 principal, request PMI removal at 80% LTV. Total cost: $7,440 PMI + $20,000 prepay = $27,440 to eliminate $310/month PMI.

## When to Choose Conforming vs. Jumbo

### Choose Conforming (Standard or High-Balance) If:

✅ **Purchase price under conforming limit** for your county  
✅ **You have limited down payment** (5-15% available)  
✅ **Your credit score is 640-720** (harder to get jumbo at this tier)  
✅ **Your reserves are limited** (under 6 months liquid assets)  
✅ **You want lower rate** (conforming rates 0.25-0.50% better than jumbo)

### Jumbo Makes Sense If:

✅ **Purchase price exceeds conforming limit** (no choice)  
✅ **You have 20%+ down payment** (avoids PMI)  
✅ **Your credit score is 740+** (best jumbo pricing)  
✅ **You have 12+ months reserves** (meets jumbo requirements)  
✅ **You prefer no PMI** vs. lower down payment with PMI

### The Gray Area: $800K-$1.1M in High-Cost Counties

**This is where location determines everything.**

In Orange County, Seattle, or NYC area: Your $900,000 loan is conforming (better rates, lower down payment).

In Dallas, Phoenix, or Atlanta: Your $900,000 loan is jumbo (higher rates, higher down payment requirements).

**Same home, different financing costs—purely based on geography.**

## The Bottom Line

**My $825,000 purchase in Orange County qualified as high-balance conforming**—saving me compared to jumbo financing:

- **Down payment:** $82,500 (10%) vs. $123,750 (15% jumbo)—saved $41,250 upfront
- **Rate:** 7.00% conforming vs. 7.375% jumbo—saved 0.375%
- **Qualification:** 50% DTI accepted vs. 43% jumbo max—I wouldn't have qualified for jumbo

**But I'm paying PMI:** $310/month until I hit 80% LTV (2-4 years away)

**My advice:**

### If You're in a High-Cost County:

✅ **Verify your conforming limit** before assuming you need jumbo—check at <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a>  
✅ **Maximize conforming financing** if you qualify (better rates, lower down payment)  
✅ **Plan PMI elimination** once you hit 20% equity (2-4 years typically)

### If You're in a Standard-Limit County:

✅ **Understand you'll need jumbo** for purchases over $766,550  
✅ **Prepare 15-20% down payment** and 6-12 months reserves  
✅ **Optimize your <a href="https://www.middlecreditscore.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">credit score</a>** to 740+ for best jumbo rates  
✅ **Consider <a href="https://www.cash-outrefinance.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">cash-out refinance</a>** on current home to fund jumbo down payment

**Location matters as much as loan amount when determining conforming vs. jumbo financing.**

**Connect with <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">loan specialists</a> who understand your county's conforming limits and can structure optimal financing for your purchase price.**

**For me, being in Orange County made the difference between qualifying (conforming) and not qualifying (would've needed jumbo with higher down payment I didn't have).**
