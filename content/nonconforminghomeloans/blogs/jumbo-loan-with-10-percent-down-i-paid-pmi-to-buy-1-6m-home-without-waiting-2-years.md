When my husband and I started looking at homes in Denver's Cherry Creek neighborhood in late 2023, we quickly realized that $1.6 million was the entry point for the 4-bedroom homes we needed for our growing family.

**Our financial situation:**
- Combined income: $420,000/year
- Savings: $220,000 (enough for 10% down + closing + reserves)
- Credit scores: 724 (me), 738 (husband)
- Current housing: Renting townhome at $3,800/month

**The math:**
- 20% down on $1.6M = $320,000
- We had only $220,000 saved
- **Shortfall: $100,000**

**Our options:**
1. Wait 2 more years to save additional $100,000 for 20% down
2. Buy a cheaper home under $1.1M where our $220,000 = 20% down
3. Find a jumbo lender accepting 10% down with mortgage insurance

**Most people told us:** "Jumbo loans require 20% down. You'll have to wait or buy cheaper."

**What we discovered:** Some portfolio lenders offer jumbo mortgages with 10% down plus jumbo PMI.

Here's our complete story—how we bought a $1.6M home with 10% down, what jumbo PMI costs us, and whether buying now versus waiting 2 years to save 20% down made financial sense.

## Understanding Jumbo Loans With Less Than 20% Down

### The Traditional Jumbo Requirement: 20% Down

**Standard jumbo underwriting:**
- 20% down payment minimum ($320,000 on $1.6M home)
- No mortgage insurance required
- Credit score 700+ (720+ for best rates)
- DTI under 43%
- 6-12 months reserves

**This is what 80% of jumbo lenders require—20% down, period.**

### The Alternative: Jumbo PMI Programs

**Some portfolio and specialized lenders offer:**
- 10-15% down payment options
- Jumbo mortgage insurance (PMI) to protect lender
- Slightly higher rates (0.125-0.25% premium)
- Otherwise similar qualification requirements

**Jumbo PMI vs. Conventional PMI:**

| Feature | Conventional PMI | Jumbo PMI |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Rate | 0.50-1.00% annually | 0.25-0.50% annually |
| When it drops | 78% LTV automatic | 75-80% LTV, lender approval |
| Typical cost | $200-400/month | $300-700/month (higher loan amounts) |
| Availability | Most lenders | Limited portfolio lenders |

**Key insight:** Jumbo PMI rates are actually lower than conventional PMI (0.35% vs. 0.50%+) but monthly cost is higher due to larger loan amounts.

### Finding a Lender

**Of 8 jumbo lenders we contacted:**
- 5 required 20% down (no exceptions)
- 2 offered 15% down with jumbo PMI
- 1 offered 10% down with jumbo PMI (higher credit requirements)

**We found our lender through** <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">Browse Lenders</a> which connected us with a portfolio lender specializing in low-down jumbo loans.

**Not widely advertised—you have to ask specifically about jumbo PMI programs.**

## Our 10% Down Jumbo Loan Qualification

### Our Financial Profile

**Combined income:** $420,000/year ($35,000/month gross)

**Credit scores:** 724 (me), 738 (husband)—lender used my lower 724 score for rate pricing

**Down payment saved:** $220,000 (enough for 10% + closing + reserves)

**Monthly debts:**
- Two car payments: $1,150/month combined
- Student loans: $875/month
- Credit cards: $0 (paid in full monthly)
- **Total debt:** $2,025/month

**Home we wanted:**
- Purchase price: $1,600,000
- Location: Denver (Cherry Creek)
- Loan needed: $1,440,000 (10% down)

### Loan Terms We Received

**Jumbo loan with 10% down + PMI:**
- Purchase price: $1,600,000
- Down payment (10%): $160,000
- Loan amount: $1,440,000
- Interest rate: 7.125% (vs. 6.875% with 20% down)
- Jumbo PMI: 0.35% annually = $420/month
- Loan term: 30 years fixed

**Monthly payment breakdown:**
- Principal & interest: $9,695
- Jumbo PMI: $420/month
- Property taxes: $1,467/month (about 1.1% annually in Denver)
- Insurance: $265/month
- **Total monthly payment:** $11,847

**Debt-to-income ratio:**
- Monthly gross income: $35,000
- Total monthly obligations: $11,847 housing + $2,025 debt = $13,872
- **DTI:** 39.6%

**Qualified comfortably under 43% DTI limit.**

**Closing costs:** $45,000 (about 2.8% of purchase—slightly higher for jumbo)

**Total cash needed:** $160,000 down + $45,000 closing = $205,000

**Reserves remaining:** $220,000 - $205,000 = $15,000 cash + $48,000 accessible in retirement accounts = $63,000 total (about 5.3 months reserves)

### The Alternative: 20% Down (If We Waited 2 Years)

**To accumulate $320,000 for 20% down:**
- Current savings: $220,000
- Need to save: $100,000 more
- Monthly savings rate: $4,200/month (after covering $3,800 rent and expenses)
- **Time to save $100,000:** 24 months

**20% down loan terms (projected):**
- Purchase price: $1,600,000 (assuming no appreciation during wait—unrealistic)
- Down payment (20%): $320,000
- Loan amount: $1,280,000
- Interest rate: 6.875% (better rate with 20% down)
- No PMI required
- Monthly P&I: $8,420
- Taxes + insurance: $1,732
- **Total monthly payment:** $10,152

**Payment comparison:**
- 10% down payment today: $11,847/month
- 20% down payment in 2 years: $10,152/month
- **Difference:** $1,695/month

**But this assumes home price stays at $1.6M—which was unrealistic in Denver's market.**

## The Real Analysis: Denver Market Appreciation

### Market Context

**Denver Cherry Creek appreciation (2023-2024):** 6-8% annually

**Conservative estimate:** 6% annual appreciation over 2 years = 12.36% cumulative

**Projected home price in 2 years:** $1,600,000 × 1.1236 = **$1,797,760**

**20% down on $1.798M:** $359,552 (vs. $320,000 on $1.6M price)

**Now we need to save:** $359,552 - $220,000 = **$139,552** (not just $100,000)

**At $4,200/month savings rate:** 33 months (not 24 months)

**And this assumes 6% appreciation—if appreciation continued at 8%, we'd never catch up saving $4,200/month while prices rose $128,000/year.**

### Full Financial Comparison: Buy Now vs. Wait 2 Years

**Option 1: Buy now with 10% down at $1.6M**

**Initial costs:**
- Down payment: $160,000
- Closing: $45,000
- **Total:** $205,000

**Monthly payment:** $11,847 (including $420 PMI)

**2-year total costs:**
- Initial costs: $205,000
- 24 monthly payments: $11,847 × 24 = $284,328
- **Total spent:** $489,328

**Equity after 2 years:**
- Principal paydown: $64,200
- Home appreciation (6% annually): $197,760 (home now worth $1,797,760)
- **Total equity:** $261,960

**Net cost:** $489,328 - $261,960 = **$227,368**

---

**Option 2: Wait 2 years, buy at $1.798M with 20% down**

**2 years of renting:**
- Rent: $3,800/month × 24 = $91,200
- Annual rent increases (5%): add $4,560
- **Total rent:** $95,760

**Purchase at higher price:**
- Purchase price: $1,797,760
- Down payment (20%): $359,552
- Closing: $50,943
- **Total cash needed:** $410,495

**We'd need to save:** $410,495 - $220,000 = $190,495 over 2 years

**At $4,200/month:** We could only save $100,800 over 2 years

**Shortfall:** $89,695 (we still wouldn't have 20% down after 2 years)

**Even if we scraped together 20% down:**

**Loan amount:** $1,438,208

**Monthly payment at 6.50% (assuming rates drop):** $9,085 P&I + $1,647 taxes + $296 insurance = **$11,028/month**

**Total costs over first 2 years of ownership (Years 3-4 from today):**
- Rent paid (Years 1-2): $95,760
- Down payment + closing: $410,495
- 24 monthly payments: $11,028 × 24 = $264,672
- **Total spent:** $770,927

**Equity after Year 4 (2 years of ownership):**
- Principal paydown: $71,400
- Home appreciation (another 6% over 2 years): $224,570
- **Total equity:** $295,970

**Net cost over 4 years:** $770,927 - $295,970 = **$474,957**

---

**Comparison:**

**Buy now with 10% down:**
- Net cost after 2 years: $227,368
- Own home immediately
- Building equity from day one

**Wait 2 years for 20% down:**
- Net cost after 2 years: $95,760 (rent only, no equity)
- After 4 years total (2 years ownership): $474,957 net cost
- Lost 2 years of appreciation ($197,760)
- Paid $95,760 rent with no equity

**Buying now with 10% down saved us approximately $247,589** over 4 years compared to waiting.

## What Jumbo PMI Actually Costs Us

### Current PMI Payment

**Jumbo PMI rate:** 0.35% annually

**Loan amount:** $1,440,000

**Annual PMI:** $1,440,000 × 0.35% = $5,040

**Monthly PMI:** $420

### PMI Elimination Plan

**Jumbo PMI drops when we reach 75-80% LTV** (depending on lender—ours requires 75%).

**To hit 75% LTV:**

**Option 1: Pay down to 75% LTV**

Original home value: $1,600,000 × 75% = $1,200,000 max loan

Current loan balance: $1,440,000

Need to pay down: $240,000 (unrealistic for us)

**Option 2: Appreciation to 75% LTV**

Current loan balance: $1,440,000

Home value needed: $1,440,000 ÷ 75% = $1,920,000

Required appreciation: $320,000 (20% appreciation from $1.6M purchase price)

At 6% annual appreciation: 3.3 years to reach 20% appreciation

**Option 3: Combination of paydown + appreciation**

After 3 years:
- Loan balance: $1,376,000 (paid down $64,000)
- Home value (6% annual): $1,906,000 (19.1% appreciation)
- LTV: $1,376,000 ÷ $1,906,000 = **72.1%**

**PMI drops after 3 years**

**Total PMI paid:** $420/month × 36 months = **$15,120**

### Was PMI Worth It?

**PMI cost over 3 years:** $15,120

**Alternative (waiting 2 years for 20% down):**
- Rent paid: $95,760
- Lost appreciation: $197,760
- **Total opportunity cost:** $293,520

**Savings by buying now despite PMI:** $293,520 - $15,120 = **$278,400**

**Absolutely worth paying PMI to buy now instead of waiting.**

## Our Current Situation (18 Months Later)

**Home value today:** $1,760,000 (10% appreciation in 18 months)

**Loan balance:** $1,408,000 (paid down $32,000)

**Current equity:** $352,000 (22%)

**Current LTV:** 80%

**PMI status:** Still paying $420/month (need to hit 75% LTV for removal)

**Projected PMI elimination:** 12-18 more months (when home hits $1.88M or we prepay principal)

**Total PMI paid so far:** $420 × 18 = $7,560

**Wealth created:** $352,000 equity (from $160,000 initial investment + $7,560 PMI + principal paydown)

**If we'd waited to save 20% down:**
- Still renting (paid $68,400 more in rent)
- Missed $160,000 appreciation
- Total opportunity cost: $228,400

**Buying with 10% down + PMI was clearly the right decision.**

## Who Should Consider Jumbo Loans With 10-15% Down?

### Ideal Candidates for Low-Down Jumbo + PMI

✅ **High income but limited savings** (young professionals, dual-income couples)  
✅ **Strong credit scores** (720+ for best jumbo PMI terms)  
✅ **Appreciating markets** (6%+ annual appreciation)  
✅ **Currently renting** (rent comparable to or higher than mortgage payment)  
✅ **Plan to stay 5+ years** (time to build equity and eliminate PMI)  
✅ **Confident income growth** (can prepay or refinance to eliminate PMI faster)

### When 20% Down Makes More Sense

✅ **You're 6-12 months away from 20% down** (short wait, minimal opportunity cost)  
✅ **Market is stable or declining** (no urgency to buy)  
✅ **You already own** (not paying rent while saving)  
✅ **Jumbo PMI unavailable** in your area (limited lender options)  
✅ **Your DTI is tight** (can't afford extra $300-700/month PMI)

## The Bottom Line

**We bought a $1.6M home with 10% down ($160,000) and pay $420/month jumbo PMI.**

**Alternative was waiting 2 years to save 20% down—which would've cost us:**
- $95,760 in rent
- $197,760 in lost appreciation
- **Total opportunity cost: $293,520**

**Compared to:**
- $15,120 total PMI cost over 3 years (until elimination)
- **Net savings: $278,400** by buying now with 10% down

**Our advice:**

### Buy With 10-15% Down + Jumbo PMI If:

✅ Market is appreciating 5%+ annually  
✅ You're paying high rent ($3,000+/month)  
✅ You have 720+ credit and strong income  
✅ Waiting 2+ years to save 20% down  
✅ You can afford $300-700/month PMI

### Wait for 20% Down If:

✅ Market is flat or declining  
✅ You're close to 20% down (under 12 months away)  
✅ You already own (not paying rent)  
✅ Your DTI can't support PMI payment  
✅ Jumbo PMI not available in your area

**Connect with <a href="https://www.browselenders.com" class="text-accent hover:underline" target="_blank">portfolio lenders</a>** who offer jumbo PMI programs—not all jumbo lenders provide this option.

**For us, buying with 10% down and paying $420/month PMI beat waiting 2 years by over $278,000.**

**In appreciating markets, time is more valuable than avoiding PMI.**
