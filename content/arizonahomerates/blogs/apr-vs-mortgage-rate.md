## What's the Difference Between Rate and APR?

Arizona mortgage borrowers frequently encounter two rate quotes that sound similar but tell very different stories about total borrowing cost.

**Mortgage Rate:** The interest percentage applied to your loan balance each month. A 6.50% rate means you pay 6.50% annual interest on the outstanding principal.

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** The total cost of borrowing expressed as an annual percentage, including the mortgage rate PLUS all lender fees, points, and closing costs annualized over the loan term.

**Simple example:**
- Mortgage rate quote: 6.50%
- Origination fee: $8,000 (1.2% of $667K loan)
- Discount points: $3,000 (additional upfront cost)
- APR calculation: Blends the 6.50% rate with $11,000 total fees into an effective annual rate
- Resulting APR: approximately 6.72%

**The 0.22% APR gap ($11,000 in fees) doesn't sound large until you calculate real monthly costs:**
- At 6.50% rate: $4,236/month principal + interest
- At 6.72% APR equivalent: $4,308/month true cost
- **Difference: $72/month or $2,160 over 30 years** from origination fees alone

## Why Arizona Lenders Quote Both Rate and APR

Federal law (Truth in Lending Act) requires lenders disclose both mortgage rate and APR on Loan Estimates. The requirement protects borrowers by forcing transparency about total costs—not just the attractive "rate."

**Lender transparency requirement:**
- Rate: What you pay in interest monthly
- APR: What you actually pay in total cost annually
- Purpose: Prevent lenders from hiding fees behind low advertised rates

**Real-world scenario:**
- Lender A: 6.25% rate, $11,000 fees → approximately 6.50% APR
- Lender B: 6.50% rate, $2,000 fees → approximately 6.55% APR
- **Deceptive marketing:** Lender A's 6.25% rate sounds better, but Lender B's true cost is actually lower (0.05% APR advantage)

## What's Included in Arizona APR Calculations

Arizona Loan Estimates include these components in APR calculations:

**Always included in APR:**
- Origination fee (1–2% of loan amount)
- Discount points (if any)
- Loan processing fees
- Underwriting fees
- Appraisal fees
- Credit report fees
- Title insurance lender's portion
- Recording fees
- Transfer taxes
- Homeowners insurance (first year, if escrowed)

**NOT included in APR:**
- Property taxes (future estimates)
- HOA fees
- Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) paid separately
- Flood insurance
- Closing costs paid by seller or third parties

**Why some costs are excluded:** APR focuses on "finance charges"—costs directly attributable to borrowing. Property taxes exist regardless of financing, so they're excluded. PMI paid monthly (not upfront) is sometimes excluded or handled separately.

## Arizona APR Comparison: Real Examples

### Conforming Loan Example ($600K Phoenix Purchase)

**Lender A: "Low Rate" Strategy**
- Mortgage rate: 6.25%
- Origination: $8,400 (1.4%)
- Points: 0.5 = $3,000
- Processing/underwriting/appraisal: $2,500
- Total upfront fees: $13,900
- APR: 6.58%
- Monthly payment: $3,596 (P&I only)

**Lender B: "Low Fee" Strategy**
- Mortgage rate: 6.50%
- Origination: $4,200 (0.7%)
- Points: 0
- Processing/underwriting/appraisal: $1,500
- Total upfront fees: $5,700
- APR: 6.54%
- Monthly payment: $3,689 (P&I only)

**Cost comparison over 5 years:**
- Lender A: Rate advantage ($93/month lower payment) × 60 months = $5,580 savings
- But: $13,900 upfront vs $5,700 = $8,200 additional cost
- **Net result:** Lender A costs $2,620 MORE over 5 years despite "better rate"
- Break-even point: Approximately 8.5 years; Lender A cheaper only if holding past 8.5 years

**APR comparison benefit:** Lender B's 6.54% APR vs Lender A's 6.58% APR immediately reveals the true cost advantage despite Lender B's higher rate.

### Jumbo Loan Example ($2M Scottsdale Purchase)

**Lender A: Portfolio Lender**
- Mortgage rate: 6.95%
- Origination: 1.5% = $30,000
- Points: 1.0 = $20,000
- Processing/underwriting/appraisal: $5,000
- Total fees: $55,000
- APR: 7.31%
- Monthly payment: $13,240

**Lender B: Bank Jumbo Program**
- Mortgage rate: 6.75%
- Origination: 0.75% = $15,000
- Points: 0
- Processing/underwriting/appraisal: $3,500
- Total fees: $18,500
- APR: 6.87%
- Monthly payment: $13,034

**True cost comparison:**
- **APR advantage:** Lender B 6.87% vs Lender A 7.31% (0.44% difference)
- **Monthly savings:** $206/month with Lender B
- **Over 10 years:** $24,720 total savings with lower APR lender
- **Loan Estimate comparison alone:** APR difference makes cost superiority obvious despite Lender A's superior "rate"

## How to Compare Arizona Lender APR Quotes

**When comparing Loan Estimates:**

1. **Focus on APR first** (not advertised rate)—APR represents true cost

2. **Look at APR differences:**
   - <0.10% difference = negligible (likely within margin of error)
   - 0.10–0.25% difference = significant ($1,200–3,000 over 30 years on $600K)
   - >0.25% difference = major cost gap ($3,000+ cumulative impact)

3. **Calculate break-even timelines:**
   - Lower APR but higher upfront fees = break-even at 5–7 years typically
   - If holding <5 years, choose lower upfront cost even if APR higher
   - If holding >10 years, prioritize lower APR despite higher fees

4. **Request "APR locked" comparison:**
   - Ask all lenders: "What's your APR if rates move 0.125% over next 5 days?"
   - APR-locked comparison eliminates rate-change confusion during shopping

5. **Verify identical loan scenarios:**
   - Loan amount, down payment, credit tier, property type must match
   - Different scenarios = invalid APR comparison
   - Example: Lender A 6.87% APR on $600K conforming vs Lender B 6.95% APR on $750K jumbo = not comparable

## Common Arizona APR Misunderstandings

**Myth 1: "Lower rate always means better APR"**
- Reality: High upfront fees can make low rates more expensive overall
- Example: 6.25% rate with $15,000 fees might be worse APR than 6.50% rate with $3,000 fees

**Myth 2: "APR includes property taxes and insurance"**
- Reality: APR only includes finance charges; taxes/insurance/HOA calculated separately
- Impact: Two lenders with identical APR might have different total PITI if taxes/HOA estimates vary

**Myth 3: "Points always make APR worse"**
- Reality: Borrowers paying points (upfront fees) to reduce rate trade initial cost for long-term savings
- Strategy: If holding 10+ years, paying points for lower rate often yields positive ROI

**Myth 4: "If APR matches between lenders, monthly payment will be identical"**
- Reality: APR is annualized average; identical APR might reflect different rate/fee combinations
- Check: Always verify monthly P&I payment separately, even with matching APR

### Conforming Loans ($600K or Less)

**APR shopping priority:** High impact market (many competitive lenders)
- Expect APR ranges: 6.35–6.75% for 740+ credit
- Shop 4–6 lenders for maximum competitive pressure
- Target: APR 0.15–0.25% lower than competitor averages
- Potential savings: $2,000–4,000 over 30 years

**Scenario:** $500K Phoenix purchase, 30-year conforming
- Lender A APR: 6.50%

- APR advantage for Lender B: 0.35%
- **30-year savings:** $28,000 on $2M financed amount

### Refinancing

**APR shopping priority:** Highest impact (long holding period)
- Current APR baseline exists (compare to current loan)
- New lender must justify APR increase OR offer rate reduction sufficient to offset closing costs
- Break-even analysis critical: Month to recoup $2,000–5,000 closing costs

**Scenario:** Current 7.00% on $500K, refinancing to new lender
- New Lender APR: 6.50%
- Closing costs: $3,500
- Monthly savings: $166
- **Break-even point:** 21 months (3,500 ÷ 166)
- If holding >3 years: Refi makes financial sense

## Getting Arizona Loan Estimates for APR Comparison

1. **Visit BrowseLenders.com** and request Loan Estimates from 3+ lenders
2. **Provide identical information** to all lenders (loan amount, down payment, property address)
3. **Request APR written on Loan Estimate** (required by law)
4. **Calculate break-even** using fee differences and APR gaps
5. **Ask questions:** "Is this APR locked?" "What if rates move 0.25%?" "Are there any other fees?"

## Arizona APR Final Takeaways

**Key points for Arizona borrowers:**

- **APR > Rate:** Always compare APR when evaluating lenders, not just advertised rates
- **Fee impact:** Origination and points can add 0.20–0.50% to APR; low-rate ads often hide high fees
- **Loan type matters:** Conforming loans offer many competing lenders; jumbo loans have fewer APR options
- **Holding period calculation:** Upfront fees justify better APR only if holding past break-even (typically 5–8 years)
- **Shopping impact:** 3–6 lender APR comparisons typically reveal 0.15–0.50% spread = $3,000–15,000 total savings

**Smart Arizona borrowers compare APR—not rate—and calculate true cost before locking any mortgage.**
