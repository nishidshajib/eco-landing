Refinance documentation feels overwhelming until you know what lenders actually need. Here's the full checklist, broken down by category, so you can prepare before you start shopping Florida lenders.

## Why Documentation Matters for Refinance

Lenders need to verify three things:
1. **You can afford the new payment** (income and employment)
2. **You have reserves for unexpected costs** (assets)
3. **The property is worth what you claim** (appraisal and property docs)

Even if you're just doing rate-and-term with no cash-out, lenders still verify everything. Refinance isn't a rubber stamp—it's a new loan with new underwriting.

## Income Documentation (W-2 Employees)

**What You'll Need:**
- **30 days of pay stubs** (most recent, showing year-to-date earnings)
- **2 years of W-2 forms** (from all employers)
- **2 years of federal tax returns** (1040s with all schedules)

**Why They Want This:**
Lenders calculate your gross monthly income and verify stability. Two years of employment history in the same field shows income reliability.

**Pro Tip:** If you switched jobs recently, get a written employment letter from your new employer stating your position, salary, and start date. Same industry = no problem. Different industry = expect more questions.

## Income Documentation (Self-Employed)

**What You'll Need:**
- **2 years of personal tax returns** (1040s with all schedules)
- **2 years of business tax returns** (1065, 1120, 1120S depending on entity type)
- **Year-to-date profit-and-loss statement** (signed and dated)
- **Year-to-date balance sheet** (if business owns significant assets)
- **Business bank statements** (3–12 months, depending on lender)
- **Business license** (if applicable)

**Why They Want This:**
Lenders calculate self-employed income by averaging two years of net income (after deductions). If your income is declining year-over-year, expect questions.

**Pro Tip:** Aggressive tax write-offs lower your qualifying income. That $80,000 in gross income becomes $50,000 after deductions—lenders use the $50,000 figure.

## Asset Documentation

**What You'll Need:**
- **2 months of bank statements** (all pages, all accounts)
- **2 months of investment statements** (401k, IRA, brokerage accounts)
- **Proof of other liquid assets** (CDs, money market accounts, stocks)

**Why They Want This:**
Lenders verify you have reserves to cover 2–6 months of mortgage payments after closing. Higher loan amounts or lower credit scores = higher reserve requirements.

**Pro Tip:** Large deposits (anything over 25% of your monthly income) require explanation. Gift funds need a signed letter from the donor stating it's a gift, not a loan.

## Property Documentation

**What You'll Need:**
- **Homeowners insurance policy** (declarations page showing coverage amounts)
- **Property tax bill** (most recent annual or semi-annual statement)
- **HOA documents** (if applicable—fees, contact info, proof of insurance)
- **Current mortgage statement** (showing balance, rate, payment history)
- **Appraisal** (lender orders this, but you pay for it—$400–$700 in Florida)

**Why They Want This:**
Lenders need to confirm property value, verify you're current on payments, and calculate escrow requirements for taxes and insurance.

**Pro Tip:** If your home has flood risk, lenders may require flood insurance. Check FEMA flood maps before refinancing—unexpected flood insurance can kill a deal.

## Cash-Out Refinance: Extra Documentation

If you're pulling cash out, lenders want to know how you'll use it. Be ready to provide:

**Debt Consolidation**
- **Payoff statements** for all debts you're consolidating
- **Account numbers** and creditor contact info

**Home Improvements**
- **Contractor estimates** or bids (if using cash for renovations)
- **Detailed scope of work** explaining the project

**Other Uses**
- **Written explanation** of how funds will be used (education, investment, emergency savings)

Lenders don't dictate how you use cash-out funds, but they want documentation showing responsible planning.

## Credit and Identity Documentation

**What You'll Need:**
- **Government-issued ID** (driver's license or passport)
- **Social Security card** or proof of SSN
- **Credit report authorization** (lender provides this form)

**Why They Want This:**
Identity verification prevents fraud. Credit authorization lets lenders pull your tri-merge report.

**Pro Tip:** If you've had a name change (marriage, divorce), provide documentation showing old and new names.

## What Happens If You're Missing Documents

Lenders won't move forward until they have everything. Missing docs = delayed closing or denial.

**Common Issues:**
- **Incomplete tax returns** (missing schedules or W-2s)
- **Expired insurance** (policy needs to be active through closing)
- **Undocumented large deposits** (anything over 25% of monthly income)
- **Gap in employment** (lenders want explanation letters)

If you're missing something, ask your lender what's acceptable as a substitute. Sometimes pay stubs can replace W-2s, or a CPA letter can verify income.

## 7-Day Documentation Prep Plan

**Day 1–2: Income Docs**
Gather pay stubs, W-2s, and tax returns. Self-employed? Add business returns and P&L.

**Day 3–4: Asset Docs**
Download 2 months of bank and investment statements. Check for large deposits—get ready to explain them.

**Day 5: Property Docs**
Pull your mortgage statement, insurance declarations, and property tax bill.

**Day 6: Credit Check**
Review your middle credit score and dispute any errors you find.

**Day 7: Organize and Review**
Put everything in one digital folder. Label files clearly (e.g., "2024_W2_Employer_Name"). Double-check you have all pages.

## How to Share Documents Securely

Never email sensitive documents without encryption. Use:
- **Lender's secure portal** (most Florida lenders provide this)
- **Encrypted file-sharing services** (Google Drive, Dropbox with password protection)
- **Secure upload tools** (some lenders use DocuSign or similar platforms)

Avoid texting or emailing Social Security numbers, account numbers, or unredacted documents.
