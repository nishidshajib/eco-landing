Rate-and-term refinance doesn't give you cash—it just changes your loan structure. Lower rate, shorter term, or both. But is it worth the closing costs? Here's how Florida homeowners figure that out.

## What Rate-and-Term Refinance Actually Changes

You're refinancing your current loan balance (or close to it) into a new loan with different terms. Common goals:

- **Lower your interest rate** to reduce monthly payments or total interest paid
- **Shorten your loan term** (30-year to 15-year) to build equity faster
- **Switch loan types** (ARM to fixed-rate for payment stability)
- **Remove PMI** if your equity now exceeds 20%

No cash-out, no equity extraction—just a new loan that (hopefully) works better for your situation.

## When the Math Works in Your Favor

Rate-and-term makes sense when the numbers check out. Here's what to calculate:

### Break-Even Point

Add up your closing costs. Divide that by your monthly payment savings. That's how many months until you "break even."

**Example:** $4,000 in closing costs ÷ $150 monthly savings = 27 months to break even.

If you plan to stay in the home longer than 27 months, refinancing could make sense. If you're selling in a year, skip it.

### Total Interest Saved

Even if your monthly payment doesn't drop much, switching from 30-year to 15-year can save six figures in interest over the life of the loan. Run an amortization calculator to see the difference.

### PMI Removal Opportunity

If your home value has climbed and you now have 20%+ equity, rate-and-term refinance can eliminate private mortgage insurance. That's $50–$200+ saved monthly, depending on your loan size.

## What Florida Lenders Request for Rate-and-Term

Documentation is similar to your original purchase, but typically lighter since you're already a homeowner:

- **Current mortgage statement** (balance, rate, payment history)
- **Income verification** (W-2s, pay stubs, tax returns if self-employed)
- **Asset documentation** (bank statements showing reserves)
- **Credit report** (lenders pull this, but check yours first)
- **Property appraisal** (to confirm value and equity position)
- **Homeowners insurance** proof of coverage

Most lenders ask for 2 years of tax returns and 30–60 days of pay stubs. Self-employed borrowers need more documentation—1099s, profit-and-loss statements, business bank statements.

## 4-Week Rate-and-Term Prep Plan

**Week 1: Gather Current Loan Details**
- Pull your latest mortgage statement
- Note your current rate, balance, and monthly payment
- Check if you have PMI and what it costs

**Week 2: Check Credit and Income**
- Review your middle credit score (all three bureaus)
- Dispute any errors you find
- Organize income docs (W-2s, pay stubs, tax returns)

**Week 3: Calculate Scenarios**
- Use refinance calculators to model rate changes
- Calculate break-even points for different scenarios
- Estimate total interest savings over loan life

**Week 4: Compare Florida Lenders**
- Browse Florida-licensed refinance lenders
- Request upfront cost estimates from 2–3 options
- Compare closing costs, not just rates

Don't rush. Lenders want your business—take time to prepare and compare.

## When Rate-and-Term Doesn't Make Sense

Skip rate-and-term refinance if:

- **Your break-even is longer than you'll stay in the home.** Selling in 18 months? Don't refinance if break-even is 30 months.
- **Closing costs are too high relative to savings.** $6,000 in costs for $75/month savings? That's a 6.5-year break-even—too long.
- **Your credit score has dropped.** If your score was 740 at purchase and it's now 680, you might not get a better rate.
- **You're already low on your current loan.** If you bought 15 years ago and have 10 years left, switching to a new 30-year resets the clock.

Run the numbers. If it doesn't save money or align with your goals, don't do it.

## How to Compare Lenders Without Getting Spammed

Request loan estimates from 2–3 Florida refinance lenders within a 14-day window. Credit bureaus count multiple mortgage inquiries as one hit if done in a short period.

Ask for:
- **Total closing costs** (including lender fees, appraisal, title, escrow)
- **Annual percentage rate (APR)** to compare true cost including fees
- **Loan estimate form** (required within 3 business days of application)

Don't settle for vague "we'll beat anyone's rate" promises. Get written estimates and compare line-by-line.
