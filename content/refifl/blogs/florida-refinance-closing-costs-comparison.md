Refinance closing costs can run $3,000–$8,000+ in Florida, depending on your loan size and lender. Here's what you're actually paying for—and how to shop lenders without getting ripped off.

## What's Included in Refinance Closing Costs

Closing costs break into three categories: lender fees, third-party fees, and prepaid/escrow items.

### Lender Fees (Negotiable)

**Origination Fee (0.5–1.5% of loan amount)**
What the lender charges to process your loan. Some lenders call this "points" or "loan discount fees." This is where shopping pays off—rates vary wildly.

**Application Fee ($0–$500)**
Some lenders charge upfront. Others waive it or roll it into origination.

**Underwriting Fee ($400–$900)**
Covers the cost of reviewing your file and verifying documentation.

**Processing Fee ($300–$700)**
Administrative costs for preparing documents and coordinating the loan.

Not all lenders charge all these fees. Some bundle them into one origination charge. Compare line-by-line, not just the bottom line.

### Third-Party Fees (Less Negotiable)

**Appraisal ($400–$700 in Florida)**
Required to confirm property value. You pay even if the refinance doesn't close.

**Title Search and Insurance ($800–$1,500)**
Title company verifies ownership and insures against defects. Florida is a title insurance state—this isn't optional.

**Settlement/Closing Fee ($300–$600)**
What the title company or attorney charges to handle closing.

**Recording Fees ($50–$200)**
County charges to record the new mortgage.

**Credit Report ($30–$75)**
Lender pulls a tri-merge report. You pay for it.

**Flood Certification ($15–$25)**
Determines if your property is in a FEMA flood zone.

**Survey (Sometimes Required, $300–$500)**
Some lenders require a new survey. Others accept your original purchase survey if it's recent.

### Prepaid Items and Escrow (Not Actually Fees)

**Prepaid Interest ($200–$800)**
Interest from closing date to the end of the month. The later in the month you close, the less you pay.

**Homeowners Insurance (1 year upfront, $1,200–$3,000+)**
Lenders require proof of insurance before closing. Coastal Florida = higher premiums.

**Property Taxes (2–6 months into escrow, varies)**
If you escrow taxes, lenders collect 2–6 months upfront to cover future payments.

**HOA Transfer Fee ($100–$500, if applicable)**
Some HOAs charge when ownership transfers (even on refinance).

These aren't fees—they're expenses you'd pay anyway. But they hit at closing, so budget for them.

## How to Read a Loan Estimate

Within 3 business days of applying, lenders must provide a **Loan Estimate**—a standardized 3-page form that breaks down costs.

**Page 1: Loan Terms and Costs**
- Loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment
- Estimated total closing costs
- Estimated cash to close

**Page 2: Detailed Cost Breakdown**
- Section A: Origination charges (lender fees)
- Section B: Services you cannot shop for (title, appraisal if lender chooses)
- Section C: Services you can shop for (title, if you choose the company)
- Section E: Taxes and government fees
- Section F: Prepaids
- Section G: Initial escrow payment

**Page 3: Summary and Comparisons**
- 5-year cost comparison
- APR (interest rate + fees = true cost)
- Estimated payoff timeline

Compare Loan Estimates side-by-side from multiple lenders. Focus on Section A (origination charges) and total closing costs in Section J.

## What You Can Negotiate (and What You Can't)

**Negotiable:**
- Origination fee / points
- Application fee
- Processing fee
- Some title fees (if you shop for your own title company)

**Not Negotiable:**
- Appraisal fee (set by appraiser)
- Recording fees (set by county)
- Credit report fee
- Flood certification
- Property taxes and insurance (set by government/insurer)

Shop lender fees hard. Third-party fees are mostly fixed, but you can save $1,000–$3,000 by comparing lenders' origination charges.

## 3 Ways to Compare Florida Refinance Lenders

**1. Request Loan Estimates from 3 Lenders**
Apply to 3 lenders within 14 days. Credit bureaus count multiple mortgage inquiries as one hard pull if done in a short window.

**2. Compare APR, Not Just Rate**
APR includes fees, so a 6.5% rate with $5,000 in fees might have a higher APR than a 6.625% rate with $2,000 in fees. Lower APR = better deal.

**3. Calculate Break-Even**
Total closing costs ÷ monthly savings = months to break even. If you're paying $4,500 to save $200/month, break-even is 22.5 months. Selling before that? Don't refinance.

## No-Closing-Cost Refinance: Should You Do It?

Some lenders offer "no-closing-cost" refinance. You're not actually avoiding fees—you're either:

**1. Rolling Costs Into the Loan**
Your loan balance increases by the cost of closing fees. You pay interest on those fees for 15–30 years.

**2. Paying a Higher Rate**
Lender covers closing costs but bumps your rate 0.25–0.5%. You pay more interest over the loan life.

**When It Makes Sense:**
- You're selling in 2–3 years (break-even is far out)
- You don't have cash for closing costs
- Rates are dropping and you plan to refinance again soon

**When It Doesn't:**
- You're staying in the home long-term (higher rate costs more over time)
- You have cash to cover costs (paying upfront saves money)

Run the math. Sometimes paying $4,000 now saves $15,000 over 10 years.

## How to Avoid Junk Fees

Watch for these sneaky charges:

**Document Preparation Fee**
Already covered by origination or processing. Challenge this.

**Courier Fee**
Some lenders charge $50–$100 to send documents. This should be included in processing.

**Email or Fax Fee**
Yes, some lenders charge to email you documents. Ridiculous and negotiable.

**Notary Fee (if excessive)**
$50–$100 is normal. $200+? Push back.

If you see fees that seem redundant, ask the lender to explain or waive them. Many will.

## When to Walk Away from a Refinance

Closing costs are too high if:

- **Break-even exceeds your timeline.** Selling in 3 years but break-even is 5 years? Pass.
- **Total fees exceed 3–4% of loan amount.** $8,000 in costs on a $150,000 loan? Shop harder.
- **Lender won't provide Loan Estimate.** Federal law requires it within 3 days of application. No estimate = red flag.
- **Fees change drastically at closing.** Minor adjustments are normal. $2,000 in surprise fees? Walk.

Don't let sunk costs (appraisal fee) trap you into a bad deal. If the numbers don't work, cancel and refinance when they do.

## 5-Step Lender Shopping Checklist

**Step 1: Request Loan Estimates**
Apply to 3 Florida refinance lenders within 14 days.

**Step 2: Compare Line-by-Line**
Focus on Section A (origination) and total closing costs.

**Step 3: Calculate APR**
Lower APR = better deal when comparing similar loan terms.

**Step 4: Calculate Break-Even**
Total costs ÷ monthly savings = months to break even.

**Step 5: Negotiate**
Push back on high origination fees or redundant charges.

Don't settle for the first offer. Lenders compete for your business—make them earn it.
