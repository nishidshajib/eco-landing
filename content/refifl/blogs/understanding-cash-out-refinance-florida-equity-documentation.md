You've built equity in your Florida home. Now you're wondering how much you can access through cash-out refinance—and what hoops you'll need to jump through to get there. Here's what actually happens when Florida lenders review cash-out requests.

## How Florida Lenders Calculate Your Available Equity

Your equity is simple math: current home value minus what you owe. But how much of that equity you can access depends on loan-to-value (LTV) limits and program guidelines.

**Most conventional cash-out refinance programs cap at 80% LTV.** That means if your home is worth $400,000, lenders typically let you borrow up to $320,000—minus what you currently owe. If you owe $200,000, you could access up to $120,000 in cash.

Some programs go higher—VA loans often allow 100% cash-out, and FHA may go to 85%. But these come with their own documentation and qualification standards.

## What Documentation Florida Lenders Request for Cash-Out

Lenders want to see how you'll use the money and whether you can handle the new payment. Here's what they typically ask for:

- **Current mortgage statement** showing balance and payment history
- **Income verification** (W-2s, pay stubs, or tax returns if self-employed)
- **Asset statements** to document reserves after closing
- **Property appraisal** to confirm current value
- **Credit report** (they'll pull this, but check yours first)
- **Use-of-funds statement** explaining where the cash is going

Some lenders want more detail if you're consolidating debt or funding home improvements. Be ready to explain the plan.

## Quick Equity Prep Checklist

Before you contact a Florida refinance lender, knock these out:

1. **Check your current loan balance** via your servicer's website or monthly statement
2. **Estimate your home's value** using recent comps or online valuation tools
3. **Calculate rough LTV** (loan amount ÷ home value × 100)
4. **Review your middle credit score** to spot any red flags
5. **Document your income** so you're ready when asked
6. **List your debts** to calculate post-refinance DTI

You don't need exact numbers yet, but ballpark figures help you figure out if cash-out makes sense before you share personal details with lenders.

## Why Some Homeowners Walk Away from Cash-Out

Not every refinance is worth doing. Here's when the math doesn't add up:

- **Closing costs eat too much equity.** If you're only pulling out $15,000 but paying $8,000 in fees, is it worth it?
- **New payment strains your budget.** A higher loan balance means a higher payment—even at a lower rate.
- **Credit score limits your options.** Below 620, conventional cash-out gets tough. FHA may work, but costs more.
- **LTV caps leave you short.** If you need $60,000 but can only access $40,000 at 80% LTV, you're stuck.

Run scenarios first. Model what the new payment looks like and whether the cash justifies the cost.

## How to Compare Florida Refinance Lenders

Once you know your numbers, start browsing lenders who specialize in Florida refinance. Look for professionals who:

- Explain LTV limits and program differences clearly
- Provide upfront cost estimates without pushing applications
- Walk you through documentation requirements before collecting anything
- Respect your timeline and let you compare options

Don't settle for the first offer. Florida homeowners benefit from shopping multiple lenders and comparing total costs—not just rates.
