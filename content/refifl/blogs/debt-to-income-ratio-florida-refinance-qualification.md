Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) determines whether lenders approve your refinance—and it's something you can actually control. Here's how Florida lenders calculate it and what you can do to improve it.

## What DTI Actually Measures

DTI is simple: **total monthly debt payments ÷ gross monthly income × 100**

Lenders want to see how much of your income goes toward debt. Lower DTI = lower risk. Higher DTI = higher risk (or denial).

**Example:**
- Gross monthly income: $7,000
- Monthly debt payments: $2,800 (new mortgage + car + credit cards + student loans)
- DTI: $2,800 ÷ $7,000 × 100 = **40%**

Most conventional refinance programs max out at 43–50% DTI, depending on other factors like credit score and reserves.

## What Counts as Debt (and What Doesn't)

**What Lenders Include:**
- New mortgage payment (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA)
- Car loans and leases
- Student loans (even if deferred)
- Credit card minimum payments
- Personal loans
- Child support and alimony
- Other mortgages (rental properties, second homes)

**What Lenders Exclude:**
- Utilities (electric, water, internet)
- Cell phone bills
- Groceries and gas
- Subscriptions (Netflix, gym memberships)
- Medical bills (unless they're in collections with a payment plan)

If it reports to your credit and requires a monthly payment, it counts toward DTI.

## DTI Limits by Loan Program

Different refinance programs have different DTI maximums:

**Conventional Refinance**
- 43% standard max (up to 50% with strong credit and reserves)
- Higher DTI allowed if you have 740+ credit and 6+ months reserves

**FHA Refinance**
- 43% standard max
- Up to 50% with compensating factors (high credit score, low LTV, cash reserves)

**VA Refinance (IRRRL)**
- 41% guideline (some lenders go higher)
- Residual income requirements also apply

**Jumbo Refinance**
- 43% typical max
- 38–40% preferred for best pricing

If your DTI exceeds the limit, you'll need to pay down debt or increase income before refinancing.

## How to Calculate Your Front-End and Back-End DTI

Lenders look at two ratios:

**Front-End DTI (Housing Ratio)**
New mortgage payment ÷ gross monthly income

**Example:** $2,200 mortgage ÷ $7,000 income = **31%**

Most programs want front-end DTI under 28–33%.

**Back-End DTI (Total Debt Ratio)**
All monthly debt payments ÷ gross monthly income

**Example:** $2,800 total debt ÷ $7,000 income = **40%**

This is the number lenders focus on. It includes housing + all other debt.

## 30-Day DTI Improvement Plan

If your DTI is too high, here's how to lower it fast:

**Week 1: Identify High-Impact Debts**
List all monthly debt payments. Focus on debts with less than 10 months remaining—paying these off eliminates them from DTI calculations.

**Week 2: Pay Down Small Balances**
Knock out small credit card balances or personal loans. Eliminating a $200/month payment drops your DTI by 2–3% (depending on income).

**Week 3: Negotiate Payoffs**
If you have a car loan with 8 months left, consider paying it off before refinancing. Lenders won't count the debt if it has fewer than 10 payments remaining (some lenders use 6 months).

**Week 4: Boost Income (If Possible)**
If you have side income, document it. Lenders can count freelance work, rental income, or bonuses if you provide 2 years of history.

## What Doesn't Work for Lowering DTI

Avoid these strategies—they don't help and can hurt your refinance:

**Deferring Student Loans**
Even if payments are paused, lenders still count 0.5–1% of the loan balance as a monthly payment for DTI purposes.

**Closing Credit Cards**
This doesn't lower DTI (minimum payments are based on current balance, not available credit). Plus, closing cards can hurt your credit score.

**Balance Transfers**
Moving debt from one card to another doesn't change your total debt or monthly payments. Lenders see through this.

**Co-Signer Plans**
Adding a co-borrower can help if their income is higher and debt is lower, but their debts also count toward the total DTI.

## How Cash-Out Refinance Affects DTI

If you're doing cash-out to consolidate debt, your DTI can improve—but only if you're actually paying off the debt.

**Example:**
- Current mortgage: $1,500/month
- Credit cards + car loan: $900/month
- Total debt: $2,400/month

**After cash-out refinance:**
- New mortgage (with cash-out): $2,000/month
- Paid-off credit cards and car: $0/month
- Total debt: $2,000/month

Your DTI just dropped from 40% to 33% (assuming $6,000 income). But lenders require proof you're paying off those debts at closing—you can't take cash-out and keep the credit card balances.

## How Florida Lenders Verify Income for DTI

DTI depends on accurate income calculation. Here's how lenders verify:

**W-2 Employees:**
- Base salary: Monthly gross (easy)
- Hourly: Average of last 2 years
- Bonus/commission: 2-year average (if consistent)

**Self-Employed:**
- 2-year average of net income (after business deductions)
- Declining income = lender uses lower year
- Inconsistent income = expect questions

**Other Income:**
- Rental income: 75% of gross rent (25% expense factor)
- Social Security: Full amount if it continues for 3+ years
- Alimony/child support: Full amount if it continues for 3+ years

Lenders want documentation for every income source. No docs = no credit toward qualifying income.

## What Happens If Your DTI Is Too High

If your DTI exceeds the program limit, you have three options:

**1. Pay Down Debt**
Knock out high-payment debts (car loans, credit cards) to lower your monthly obligations.

**2. Increase Income**
Add a co-borrower, document side income, or wait until your primary income increases.

**3. Wait and Reapply**
Sometimes the best move is to spend 6–12 months paying down debt before refinancing.

Don't try to hide debt or inflate income—lenders verify everything, and lying on a mortgage application is federal fraud.

## Ready to calculate your refinance DTI?

Add up your monthly debts, calculate your ratios, and identify debts to pay down before contacting Florida-licensed refinance lenders. Education first, application when your DTI is optimized.
