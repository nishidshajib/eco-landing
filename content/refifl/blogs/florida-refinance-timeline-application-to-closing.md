Florida refinance timelines run 30–45 days on average, but delays happen. Here's what to expect at each stage—and how to avoid common slowdowns.

## Phase 1: Pre-Application and Shopping (1–2 Weeks)

Before you officially apply, you're gathering documentation and comparing lenders.

**What Happens:**
- Check your credit and gather income/asset docs
- Request Loan Estimates from 2–3 Florida lenders
- Compare rates, fees, and total costs
- Choose a lender and lock your rate

**How Long It Takes:** 1–2 weeks (you control this)

**Pro Tip:** Lock your rate when you apply. Rate locks typically last 30–60 days. If closing takes longer, you may need a lock extension (sometimes free, sometimes $500+).

## Phase 2: Application and Initial Review (3–7 Days)

You submit your application and lender reviews it for completeness.

**What Happens:**
- Fill out 1003 loan application (online or with loan officer)
- Lender pulls credit and reviews initial documentation
- Lender issues Loan Estimate within 3 business days
- You receive list of required documents

**How Long It Takes:** 3–7 days

**Common Delays:**
- Incomplete application (missing info, wrong property address)
- Missing documentation (lender can't proceed without pay stubs, tax returns, etc.)

**How to Avoid Delays:** Have all docs ready before you apply. Double-check application for accuracy.

## Phase 3: Documentation and Underwriting Submission (1–2 Weeks)

You provide full documentation package and lender submits to underwriting.

**What Happens:**
- Upload or mail all required documents (income, assets, property info)
- Lender orders appraisal (takes 7–10 days in Florida)
- Lender orders title search and insurance
- File goes to underwriter for initial review

**How Long It Takes:** 1–2 weeks

**Common Delays:**
- Missing or incomplete documents (underwriter rejects file until you provide)
- Appraisal scheduling conflicts (Florida market is busy, appraisers book 1–2 weeks out)
- Large unexplained deposits (any deposit over 25% of monthly income requires documentation)

**How to Avoid Delays:** Respond to document requests same-day. If you have large deposits, explain them upfront with bank statements or gift letters.

## Phase 4: Underwriting Review (1–2 Weeks)

Underwriter verifies all documentation and determines if you meet lending guidelines.

**What Happens:**
- Underwriter reviews credit, income, assets, appraisal
- Issues "conditional approval" with list of conditions to clear
- You provide additional documentation to satisfy conditions
- Underwriter clears conditions and issues "clear to close"

**How Long It Takes:** 1–2 weeks (longer if conditions are complex)

**Common Delays:**
- Income discrepancies (W-2 doesn't match tax return, self-employed income declining)
- Low appraisal (home worth less than expected—may kill the refinance or require lower LTV)
- Unresolved credit issues (collections, late payments, judgments)
- Employment verification fails (employer doesn't respond to verification requests)

**How to Avoid Delays:** Warn your employer that a lender will call to verify employment. If you have credit issues, address them before applying.

## Phase 5: Clear to Close and Final Review (3–7 Days)

Underwriter has cleared all conditions and file moves to closing department.

**What Happens:**
- Lender prepares Closing Disclosure (itemized cost breakdown)
- You receive Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing (federal law)
- Review Closing Disclosure for accuracy
- Report any discrepancies to lender immediately
- Lender schedules closing appointment with title company

**How Long It Takes:** 3–7 days (3-day waiting period is mandatory)

**Common Delays:**
- Errors on Closing Disclosure (wrong loan amount, incorrect fees)
- Title issues (liens, judgments, ownership disputes)
- Insurance lapse (homeowners policy expired or insufficient coverage)

**How to Avoid Delays:** Review Closing Disclosure carefully. Compare it to your Loan Estimate—fees shouldn't change more than 10% without explanation.

## Phase 6: Closing Day (1–2 Hours)

You sign final documents and new loan funds.

**What Happens:**
- Meet at title company or attorney's office (or mobile notary comes to you)
- Review and sign 50+ pages of loan documents
- Wire closing costs (if required) or confirm lender credit
- Notary witnesses signatures and records deed
- Lender funds the loan (wires money to pay off old mortgage)

**How Long It Takes:** 1–2 hours for signing, 1–3 days for funding

**Common Delays:**
- Wire transfer issues (bank flags large transfer as fraud—call ahead to authorize)
- Last-minute title issues (lien discovered day-of-closing)
- Missing closing funds (didn't wire money early enough)

**How to Avoid Delays:** Wire closing funds 24 hours before closing. Confirm wire instructions over the phone (wire fraud is real—scammers send fake wiring instructions via email).

## Phase 7: Funding and Payoff (1–3 Days Post-Closing)

New lender pays off your old mortgage. You're done.

**What Happens:**
- New lender wires payoff to old lender
- Old lender releases lien (takes 2–4 weeks to receive official release)
- You receive confirmation that old loan is paid in full
- Make first payment on new loan in 30–45 days

**How Long It Takes:** 1–3 days

**Common Delays:**
- Old lender slow to process payoff (rare but happens)
- Payoff amount miscalculated (per-diem interest changes daily)

**How to Avoid Delays:** Confirm old lender received payoff within 48 hours of closing. Check your old loan account online to verify zero balance.

## Total Timeline: 30–45 Days (Typical)

**Fast Refinance (20–30 Days):**
- All docs ready upfront
- Clean credit and straightforward income
- No appraisal issues
- No underwriting conditions

**Average Refinance (30–45 Days):**
- Minor documentation requests
- Small underwriting conditions (explanations, additional statements)
- Standard appraisal turnaround

**Slow Refinance (45–60+ Days):**
- Self-employed or complex income
- Low appraisal requiring renegotiation
- Credit issues (collections, disputes)
- Employment gaps or job changes
- Title problems (liens, judgments)

## What Causes the Biggest Delays

**Appraisal Issues (7–14 Day Delay)**
Low appraisal kills deals or forces lower LTV. Order appraisal early and prepare for bad news.

**Income Documentation (3–10 Day Delay)**
Self-employed borrowers face extra scrutiny. Missing schedules or declining income = questions and delays.

**Credit Problems (1–4 Week Delay)**
Collections, disputes, or recent late payments require explanations and sometimes payoffs before closing.

**Title Issues (1–6 Week Delay)**
Liens, judgments, or ownership disputes can freeze a refinance. Title search happens early—address problems immediately.

**Employment Verification (3–7 Day Delay)**
Lenders verify employment 1–3 days before closing. If your employer doesn't respond, closing gets delayed.

## How to Speed Up Your Florida Refinance

**Before You Apply:**
- Pull credit reports and dispute errors 60 days out
- Gather 2 years of tax returns, W-2s, pay stubs, bank statements
- Check property records for liens or title issues

**During Underwriting:**
- Respond to document requests same-day
- Provide complete documents (all pages, not partial statements)
- Explain large deposits upfront (don't wait for underwriter to ask)

**Before Closing:**
- Review Closing Disclosure for errors immediately
- Wire funds 24 hours early
- Confirm old lender's payoff amount 48 hours before closing

**After Closing:**
- Verify old loan is paid off within 48 hours
- Save all closing documents (you'll need them for taxes)

## When to Expect Delays (and Plan Accordingly)

**Peak Refinance Season (Spring/Summer):**
Appraisers and underwriters are slammed. Add 1–2 weeks to timeline.

**End of Month:**
Everyone wants to close before the 1st (saves on prepaid interest). Title companies and lenders are backed up. Avoid closing last 3 days of the month if possible.

**Holidays:**
Closings don't happen on federal holidays. Lenders and title companies close. Plan around Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas.

**Self-Employed or Complex Income:**
Add 1–2 weeks for extra underwriting review. Provide detailed explanations upfront to minimize delays.

## What to Do If Your Refinance Gets Delayed

**Extend Your Rate Lock (If Needed):**
Most rate locks last 30–45 days. If closing is delayed beyond your lock period, ask for extension. Some lenders charge $500–$1,000 for extensions.

**Push Your Lender:**
If delays are lender-caused (slow underwriting, missed deadlines), escalate to a manager. Lenders have service-level commitments—hold them accountable.

**Walk Away If Necessary:**
If appraisal comes in low or costs spike, you're not obligated to close. You'll lose the appraisal fee ($400–$700), but that's better than a bad deal.
