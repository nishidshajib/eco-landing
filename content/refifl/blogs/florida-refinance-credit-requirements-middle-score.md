Your credit score determines more than just approval. It affects your rate, your available programs, and whether refinancing is even worth it. Here's how Florida lenders actually use your credit when reviewing refinance applications.

## Why Lenders Focus on Your Middle Score

You have three credit scores (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). Lenders pull all three and use the **middle** score.

Example:
- Experian: 720
- Equifax: 685
- TransUnion: 705

Your middle score is **705**—that's what lenders use for qualification and pricing.

If you're refinancing with a co-borrower, lenders use the **lower** of the two middle scores. So if your middle is 705 and your co-borrower's is 680, they'll price the loan at 680.

## Credit Score Thresholds That Matter for Refinance

Different loan programs have different credit minimums:

**Conventional Refinance**
- 620+ typically required
- 740+ gets best pricing
- 760+ gets top-tier rates in most cases

**FHA Refinance**
- 580+ for most programs
- 500–579 may qualify for limited programs
- Higher scores still get better rates

**VA Refinance (IRRRL)**
- No official minimum (depends on lender)
- Most lenders want 620+
- 640+ improves approval odds

**Jumbo Refinance**
- 700+ typically required
- 740+ preferred
- 760+ for best pricing

If you're below the minimum for your desired program, you'll need to improve your score before refinancing makes sense.

## What Hurts Your Credit Before Refinance

Avoid these moves in the 6–12 months before you plan to refinance:

**Opening New Credit Accounts**
Each application triggers a hard inquiry, which can drop your score 5–10 points. Multiple new accounts in a short period look risky to lenders.

**Maxing Out Credit Cards**
High utilization (balance ÷ credit limit) tanks your score fast. Keep utilization under 30% on each card—under 10% is better.

**Missing Payments**
One 30-day late payment can drop your score 60–100 points, depending on your starting score. Set up autopay to avoid this.

**Closing Old Accounts**
Closing credit cards shortens your credit history and can increase utilization. Keep old accounts open, even if you don't use them.

**Co-Signing Loans**
Co-signing makes you responsible for the debt. If the primary borrower misses payments, it hits your credit too.

## Quick Credit Boost Strategies (60–90 Days)

If you're planning to refinance soon, these moves can help:

**Pay Down High-Balance Cards**
Focus on cards with the highest utilization first. Getting below 30% on each card can boost your score 20–40 points in one billing cycle.

**Request Credit Limit Increases**
Higher limits = lower utilization (if you don't increase spending). Call your card issuers and ask—many approve instantly.

**Dispute Errors**
Check all three credit reports for mistakes (wrong balances, accounts that aren't yours, incorrect late payments). Dispute online through each bureau.

**Become an Authorized User**
If a family member has a card with low utilization and perfect payment history, ask to be added as an authorized user. Their positive history may report to your credit.

**Pay Bills Twice Monthly**
Credit card companies report your balance once a month—usually on your statement date. Paying twice a month keeps your reported balance lower.

## How Refinancing Affects Your Credit

**Short-Term Dip (5–10 Points)**
The credit inquiry and new loan will temporarily lower your score. This recovers in 3–6 months.

**Long-Term Benefit**
If refinancing lowers your debt-to-income ratio or consolidates high-interest debt, your credit can improve over time.

**No Impact from Shopping**
Multiple refinance inquiries within 14–45 days (depending on scoring model) count as one inquiry. Shop multiple lenders without fear.

## What Florida Lenders Check Beyond Score

Credit score isn't the only factor. Lenders also review:

- **Payment history** on your current mortgage (any 30-day lates in past 12 months?)
- **Open collections or judgments** (some lenders require these to be paid before closing)
- **Recent delinquencies** (late payments in past 6 months carry more weight)
- **Credit mix** (revolving vs. installment debt)
- **Recent inquiries** (too many in 6 months raises red flags)

You can have a 720 score and still get denied if you have a recent 30-day late on your mortgage or unpaid collections over $500.

## How to Check Your Middle Score (The Right Way)

Don't rely on free score apps—they often show VantageScore 3.0, which isn't what lenders use.

**Get Your FICO Scores:**
- Experian: Buy directly from Experian.com
- Equifax: Buy from MyFICO.com
- TransUnion: Buy from MyFICO.com or TransUnion.com

Or ask your Florida refinance lender for a tri-merge credit report during the application process. Some lenders provide a free copy.

## Ready to check your refinance eligibility?

Review your middle credit score, improve utilization if needed, and prepare your credit file before contacting Florida-licensed refinance lenders. Education first, application when your credit is optimized.
