VA cash-out refinancing lets veterans and active-duty service members convert home equity into cash while maintaining VA loan benefits—no private mortgage insurance, competitive rates, and funding fee exemptions for disabled veterans. Unlike conventional cash-out refinances that cap loan-to-value at 80%, VA cash-out allows up to **90% LTV** in most cases, and up to **100% LTV** with certain lenders.

This means you can access significantly more equity than conventional or FHA cash-out options while keeping favorable VA loan terms. However, VA cash-out refinancing comes with a 2.15%-3.3% funding fee (waived for disabled veterans), and you'll need to meet credit, income, and residual income requirements. Understanding when VA cash-out makes sense—and when it doesn't—helps you make the right financial decision.

## What Is a VA Cash-Out Refinance?

A VA cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage (VA, conventional, FHA, or USDA) with a new VA loan for a higher amount. The difference between your old loan balance and the new loan amount goes to you in cash at closing.

**Example**: Your home is worth $400,000 and you owe $250,000 on your current mortgage. You do a VA cash-out refinance at 85% LTV:

- New loan amount: $340,000 (85% of $400,000)
- Payoff existing mortgage: $250,000
- Cash to you at closing: $90,000 (minus closing costs)

You use that $90,000 for home improvements, debt consolidation, college tuition, or any other purpose—the VA doesn't restrict how you use cash-out proceeds.

## VA Cash-Out vs. VA IRRRL

The VA offers two main refinance options, and it's critical to understand the difference:

### VA IRRRL (Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan)

- **Refinances existing VA loans only** (not conventional or FHA)
- **No cash out**—you can only reduce your rate or switch from adjustable to fixed
- **No appraisal required** in most cases
- **No income verification** in most cases
- **Lower funding fee**: 0.5% (waived for disabled veterans)
- **Faster, cheaper process**

### VA Cash-Out Refinance

- **Refinances any mortgage type** (VA, conventional, FHA, USDA)
- **Cash out allowed**—access home equity
- **Appraisal required**
- **Full income and credit verification required**
- **Higher funding fee**: 2.15% first use, 3.3% subsequent use (waived for disabled veterans)
- **More documentation and higher closing costs**

If you don't need cash and only want to lower your rate, use VA IRRRL—it's faster and cheaper. If you need cash or want to refinance a non-VA loan into a VA loan, cash-out refinancing is your option.

## Maximum LTV for VA Cash-Out Refinancing

The VA allows cash-out refinancing up to **90% LTV** for most borrowers. Some lenders offer **100% LTV** cash-out refinancing, but this is less common and usually requires excellent credit and strong income.

### How LTV Affects Your Borrowing

**Example 1: 90% LTV limit**
- Home value: $500,000
- Maximum loan: $450,000 (90%)
- Current mortgage balance: $300,000
- Maximum cash out: $150,000 (minus closing costs)

**Example 2: 100% LTV limit (select lenders)**
- Home value: $500,000
- Maximum loan: $500,000 (100%)
- Current mortgage balance: $300,000
- Maximum cash out: $200,000 (minus closing costs)

Most lenders cap VA cash-out at 90% LTV to maintain cushion against market fluctuations. However, if you have strong credit (700+), stable income, and significant remaining VA entitlement, some lenders will go to 100%.

## VA Cash-Out Funding Fee

Unlike VA IRRRL's 0.5% funding fee, VA cash-out refinancing carries a **2.15%-3.3% funding fee** depending on whether it's your first or subsequent VA loan use:

| Use | Funding Fee | Example on $400,000 Loan |
|-----|-------------|-------------------------|
| First-time VA use | 2.15% | $8,600 |
| Subsequent use | 3.3% | $13,200 |
| Disabled veterans (10%+ rating) | 0% | $0 |

If you've never used a VA loan before, you'll pay 2.15%. If you've used a VA loan previously (even if you paid it off and restored entitlement), you'll pay 3.3%.

**Disabled veterans with a 10% or higher service-connected disability rating are completely exempt** from the funding fee, making VA cash-out refinancing significantly more attractive for this group.

The funding fee is rolled into your loan balance, so you don't pay it out-of-pocket at closing. However, financing the fee increases your loan amount and monthly payment.

### Calculating Break-Even on the Funding Fee

If you're not exempt from the funding fee, calculate whether the cash-out refinance makes financial sense:

**Example**: You're doing a $350,000 cash-out refinance with a 2.15% funding fee ($7,525). If you're paying off $30,000 in credit card debt at 22% APR, you'll save approximately $6,600/year in interest. The funding fee pays for itself in **14 months**—after that, you're saving money.

However, if you're pulling cash for discretionary spending (vacation, new car, etc.) and your current mortgage rate is already low, the funding fee may not justify the refinance.

## Credit Score Requirements for VA Cash-Out Refinancing

VA cash-out refinancing requires full credit underwriting, unlike VA IRRRL which often bypasses credit review. Most lenders require:

- **Minimum 620 credit score** for most lenders
- **Minimum 580 credit score** with VA specialist lenders
- **No recent late mortgage payments** (typically 12 months clean payment history required)
- **Debt-to-income ratio under 41%** (or higher with strong compensating factors)

Veterans with [middle credit scores](https://www.middlecreditscore.com) (580-680) can still qualify for VA cash-out refinancing, but expect more documentation requirements and potentially higher rates. Lenders who specialize in VA loans are more flexible with credit than big banks who impose strict overlays.

## Income and Residual Income Requirements

VA cash-out refinancing requires proof of stable income and sufficient **residual income**—the amount of money left over each month after paying all debts and estimated living expenses.

### Residual Income Thresholds for 2025

Residual income minimums vary by region and family size. For example, a family of four in the Midwest needs approximately $1,025/month in residual income, while the same family in the West needs $1,117/month.

**Example Residual Income Calculation**:
- Gross monthly income: $7,000
- Taxes and deductions: $1,400
- New mortgage payment (PITI): $2,100
- Other debts (car, student loans, credit cards): $800
- Estimated utilities and maintenance: $400
- **Residual income**: $2,300/month

This easily exceeds VA minimums, supporting approval even if the debt-to-income ratio is slightly elevated.

VA loan officers who specialize in military lending understand how to calculate residual income using BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing), disability compensation, and deployment pay—income sources that conventional lenders often mishandle.

## When VA Cash-Out Refinancing Makes Sense

### 1. Paying Off High-Interest Debt

If you're carrying credit card balances, personal loans, or auto loans at high interest rates (10%+), consolidating into a VA cash-out refinance at 6%-7% can save thousands annually.

**Example**: You have $40,000 in credit card debt at 20% APR ($8,000/year in interest). A VA cash-out refinance at 6.5% costs approximately $2,600/year in interest on that portion—saving you $5,400/year.

### 2. Home Improvements That Increase Value

Using cash-out proceeds for renovations (kitchen remodel, bathroom upgrade, new roof) can increase your home's value by more than the cost of the improvements, building long-term equity while financing at a low rate.

### 3. Avoiding PMI on a Conventional Loan

If you currently have a conventional mortgage with PMI (because you put down less than 20%), refinancing into a VA cash-out loan eliminates PMI permanently. Even if you're pulling minimal cash, the PMI savings may justify the refinance.

**Example**: Your conventional loan has $150/month PMI ($1,800/year). Refinancing to a VA loan eliminates PMI, saving $1,800/year even if the rate is slightly higher.

### 4. Funding Education Expenses

Paying for college tuition or trade school with a VA cash-out refinance (6%-7% rate) is significantly cheaper than private student loans (8%-14% rates) and gives you 30 years to repay instead of 10-20 years.

### 5. Building an Emergency Fund or Investment Capital

If you have substantial equity and no high-interest debt, pulling cash to build a 6-12 month emergency fund or invest in income-producing assets (rental property down payment, business startup, etc.) can make sense—especially if you're exempt from the funding fee.

## When VA Cash-Out Refinancing Doesn't Make Sense

### 1. Your Current Rate Is Significantly Lower Than Today's Rates

If your existing mortgage rate is 3%-4% and current VA rates are 6.5%-7%, refinancing increases your payment substantially. Unless you desperately need the cash or are paying off debt that justifies the higher rate, it may be better to explore a HELOC or home equity loan (second mortgage) that leaves your low first mortgage rate intact.

### 2. You're Not Exempt and the Funding Fee Eats Your Equity

If you're not a disabled veteran and you're paying a 3.3% funding fee on a large loan, the upfront cost can be substantial. A $500,000 cash-out refinance with subsequent-use funding fee costs $16,500. If you're only pulling $20,000 in cash, the funding fee consumes most of the benefit.

### 3. You Plan to Sell Soon

Cash-out refinancing resets your loan term to 30 years (or 15 if you choose). If you're planning to sell within 2-3 years, the closing costs and funding fee may not be worth the short-term cash access. Consider a HELOC or personal loan instead.

### 4. You're Using Cash for Discretionary Spending

Pulling equity to fund vacations, luxury purchases, or depreciating assets (cars, boats, etc.) is generally a poor financial decision. Home equity is a valuable asset—using it wisely (debt consolidation, home improvements, education) makes sense, but spending it on lifestyle inflation does not.

## VA Cash-Out vs. HELOC vs. Home Equity Loan

Veterans have three main options for accessing home equity. Here's how they compare:

| Feature | VA Cash-Out Refinance | HELOC | Home Equity Loan |
|---------|----------------------|-------|------------------|
| **Interest Rate** | Fixed, 6%-7% (2025) | Variable, 8%-10% | Fixed, 8%-10% |
| **Loan-to-Value** | Up to 90%-100% | Up to 80%-90% | Up to 85% |
| **Funding Fee** | 2.15%-3.3% (waived for disabled vets) | None | None |
| **Replaces First Mortgage** | Yes | No | No |
| **Closing Costs** | 2%-5% of loan | $0-$500 | 2%-5% of loan |
| **Best For** | Disabled veterans, high-interest debt payoff, need large lump sum | Need revolving credit, low closing costs, preserving low first mortgage rate | Need lump sum, preserving low first mortgage rate |

If you're a disabled veteran exempt from the funding fee, VA cash-out refinancing is almost always the best option—you get the lowest rate and the highest LTV. If you're not exempt and your current mortgage rate is very low, a HELOC or home equity loan may preserve your low payment while still giving you access to cash.

## Step-by-Step: How to Get a VA Cash-Out Refinance

### Step 1: Check Your Home's Current Value

Use online estimators (Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com) to estimate your home's value, but understand that lenders will require a professional appraisal. If your home has gained significant value since purchase, you may have more equity than you realize.

### Step 2: Calculate Your Maximum Cash-Out Amount

**Formula**: (Home Value × LTV Limit) - Current Mortgage Balance - Closing Costs = Cash Out

**Example**: Home worth $450,000, current mortgage $280,000, 90% LTV, $8,000 closing costs:
- ($450,000 × 0.90) - $280,000 - $8,000 = **$117,000 cash out**

### Step 3: Obtain Your Certificate of Eligibility (COE)

Lenders need your COE to verify VA loan eligibility. If you have a service-connected disability rating, your COE will show your funding fee exemption. Request your COE through eBenefits, VA.gov, or have your lender pull it electronically.

### Step 4: Compare VA Cash-Out Lenders

Not all lenders offer the same LTV limits, rate pricing, or flexibility with credit scores. Compare at least 3-5 VA lenders to find:
- Lowest rate
- Highest LTV allowance (especially if you need 100% LTV)
- Lender who approves your credit profile

[Compare VA cash-out lenders](https://www.browselenders.com) who specialize in military lending and understand residual income rules.

### Step 5: Gather Required Documentation

Lenders will need:
- **Income verification**: Pay stubs, W-2s, tax returns (for self-employed), LES (Leave and Earnings Statement) for active duty
- **Asset verification**: Bank statements showing reserves
- **VA disability documentation**: If claiming funding fee exemption
- **Current mortgage statement**: Showing balance and payment history
- **Homeowners insurance**: Current policy information

### Step 6: Complete Appraisal

The lender will order an appraisal to confirm your home's value. If the appraisal comes in lower than expected, your available cash-out amount decreases. Appraisals typically take 1-2 weeks in most markets.

### Step 7: Review Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure

Your Loan Estimate (within 3 days of applying) and Closing Disclosure (3 days before closing) will show:
- New loan amount
- Interest rate
- Funding fee (should be $0 if you're exempt)
- Closing costs
- Cash-to-borrower amount

Verify all numbers before signing.

### Step 8: Close and Receive Your Cash

At closing, you'll sign loan documents and receive your cash-out proceeds (usually via wire transfer or cashier's check). The lender pays off your old mortgage, and your new VA loan begins.

## Special Considerations for Disabled Veterans

If you have a 10% or higher service-connected disability rating, VA cash-out refinancing becomes significantly more attractive because:

1. **No funding fee**: Saves $7,500-$16,000+ depending on loan amount
2. **Lower break-even point**: Without the funding fee eating into proceeds, cash-out makes sense even for smaller amounts
3. **Better cash flow**: Eliminating the funding fee means a lower loan balance and monthly payment

Disabled veterans should prioritize VA cash-out refinancing over HELOCs or home equity loans in almost all scenarios—the rate is lower, the LTV is higher, and the funding fee exemption makes it the most cost-effective option.

## Tax Implications of VA Cash-Out Refinancing

**Mortgage interest deduction**: Interest on cash-out refinance proceeds is only tax-deductible if you use the money for home improvements. If you use proceeds for debt consolidation, education, or other purposes, that portion of the interest is not deductible.

**Example**: You do a $400,000 VA cash-out refinance. Your old mortgage was $300,000. You use $50,000 for a kitchen remodel and $50,000 to pay off credit cards. Interest on $350,000 of the loan (original $300,000 + $50,000 home improvement) is deductible. Interest on the $50,000 used for debt payoff is not deductible.

Consult a tax professional to understand how cash-out refinancing affects your specific tax situation.

## Common VA Cash-Out Refinance Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Shopping Multiple Lenders

VA cash-out rates and fees vary significantly between lenders. One lender may charge 6.75% while another charges 6.25%—that 0.5% difference costs $50,000+ in interest over 30 years on a $400,000 loan.

### Mistake 2: Extending the Loan Term Unnecessarily

If you're 10 years into a 30-year mortgage and you refinance into a new 30-year loan, you've just extended your total repayment timeline to 40 years. Consider a 20-year or 15-year refinance term to avoid paying interest for decades longer than necessary.

### Mistake 3: Using Cash-Out Proceeds for Depreciating Assets

Pulling equity to buy a car, boat, or fund a vacation means you're paying interest on those purchases for 30 years. A $30,000 car purchased with cash-out proceeds costs $50,000+ over the life of the loan when you include interest.

### Mistake 4: Not Confirming Funding Fee Exemption

If you're a disabled veteran, ensure your exemption is reflected on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. Lenders sometimes miss exemptions, costing you thousands unnecessarily.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Residual Income Requirements

VA lenders must verify you have sufficient residual income after the new loan payment. If your residual income is borderline, adding cash-out debt payoff (which improves your DTI) or documenting disability compensation (which doesn't count against DTI) can push your application to approval.

## Final Thoughts on VA Cash-Out Refinancing

VA cash-out refinancing offers veterans and active-duty service members a powerful tool to access home equity at competitive rates without private mortgage insurance. With LTV limits up to 90%-100% and funding fee exemptions for disabled veterans, it's often the most cost-effective way to tap equity compared to conventional cash-out refinancing, HELOCs, or home equity loans.

However, VA cash-out refinancing isn't right for every situation. If your current mortgage rate is significantly lower than today's rates and you're not exempt from the funding fee, preserving your low payment with a HELOC may make more sense. If you need cash for discretionary spending rather than debt consolidation or home improvements, reconsider whether borrowing against your home is the right decision.

Work with VA loan specialists who understand residual income rules, disability exemptions, and high-LTV lending. Compare multiple lenders, verify your funding fee exemption status, and use cash-out proceeds wisely to build wealth rather than fund consumption.
