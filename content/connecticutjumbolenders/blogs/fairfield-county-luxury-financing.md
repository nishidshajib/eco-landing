### Jumbo Financing for Greenwich Properties

Greenwich represents Connecticut's most exclusive market with unique financing characteristics.

**Greenwich Market Characteristics**

Greenwich's ultra-luxury segment ($2M-$15M+) extends well beyond typical jumbo parameters. Specialized financing strategies include:

**Standard Jumbo Options ($766K-$2M)**
- Agency jumbo programs with competitive rates
- Portfolio lenders frequently active in Greenwich market
- Strong lender competition keeps rates competitive
- Straightforward underwriting for qualifying borrowers
- Wide lender availability and multiple options

**Super Jumbo Options ($2M-$5M)**
- Reduced lender competition; fewer portfolio lenders
- Rate spreads wider than standard jumbo ($0.25%-0.5% premium over standard)
- Portfolio lenders increasingly preferred for flexibility
- Asset-based qualification common for borrowers with complex wealth
- Documentation requirements stricter; expect 30-40 day underwriting

**Ultra-Luxury Financing ($5M+)**
- Very limited lender options; typically 3-5 portfolio lenders
- Specialized jumbo lenders with ultra-high-balance experience
- Asset-based underwriting dominant; income documentation secondary
- Rates highly negotiable based on lender portfolio strategy
- 40-60 day underwriting timeline expected
- Non-standard loan structures possible (interest-only, ARMs, etc.)

**Greenwich Appraisal Challenges**

Ultra-luxury Greenwich properties ($3M+) face appraisal complexities:

**Limited Comparable Sales Problem**
- Properties in $3M-$5M range: Few recent comparable sales
- Properties in $5M+ range: Often only 1-3 comparable sales annually in Greenwich
- Comparable selection: Appraisers may need to use properties from surrounding towns
- Market adjustment: Appraisers apply market adjustments to out-of-area comparables
- Risk: Appraisal value may be below purchase price (appraisal challenge common)

**Appraisal Contingency Strategy:**
- Address appraisal risk upfront with larger down payment (30%+)
- Obtain pre-appraisal or broker opinion of value before purchase
- Prepare supplemental appraisal data highlighting unique property features
- Establish relationship with lender's appraiser for pre-appraisal discussion
- Plan for potential appraisal challenge resolution (additional comparables, appeal)

**Special Features Affecting Appraisal:**
- Waterfront estate status (Belle Haven, Round Hill proximity)
- Historic property designation or architectural significance
- Equestrian facilities, guest houses, or specialized structures
- Waterfront improvements (docks, bulkheads, beach rights)
- Customized design and luxury finishes

**Appraisal Recommendations:**
1. Budget 2-3 additional weeks for appraisal in ultra-luxury ($3M+) segment
2. Engage appraiser experienced with Connecticut luxury properties
3. Prepare detailed property documentation (photos, feature list, renovations)
4. Consider supplemental appraisal support if comparable sales thin
5. Establish appraisal contingency release timeline with lender

**Greenwich Income and Asset Verification**

Greenwich's high-net-worth borrowers often have complex financial structures:

**High Income Documentation (Corporate Executives)**
- Base salary verified through employment letter
- Bonus income verified through bonus agreement and 2-year documentation
- Stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) valued per brokerage statements
- Deferred compensation or non-traditional income items: CPA letter required

**Business Owner Income (Entrepreneurs)**
- Private company ownership: 2-3 years business tax returns and P&L statements
- Multi-source income: Separate documentation for each income stream
- Business equity: Business valuation documentation and financial statements
- Successful exit or recent business sale: Documentation of proceeds

**Investment Income (Wealth Management Clients)**
- Investment portfolio accounts: Quarterly statements from brokerage
- Dividend income: Documented through 1099 forms and historical dividend history
- Real estate rental income: Lease agreements, bank statements, tax return documentation
- Capital gains: Documented through brokerage statements and 1099 forms

**Asset Verification and Documentation:**
- Bank statements: 2-3 months current for liquid assets
- Investment accounts: Recent brokerage statements (quarterly minimum)
- Real estate: Recent appraisal or comparable sales analysis
- Business interest: Business tax returns and partnership agreements
- Retirement accounts: Recent 401(k) or IRA statements

**Asset-Based Qualification for Greenwich Borrowers:**
High-net-worth Greenwich borrowers may qualify through asset-based underwriting rather than traditional income documentation. Portfolio lenders specialize in this approach:
- Documented liquid assets 12-24+ months of housing payment
- Demonstrated wealth through investment accounts, real estate holdings
- Can compensate for lower credit scores or DTI concerns
- Reduces need for detailed income verification
