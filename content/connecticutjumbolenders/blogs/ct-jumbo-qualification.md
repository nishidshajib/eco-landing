## Connecticut Jumbo Loan Limits and Qualification Requirements

Connecticut's jumbo mortgage market has expanded significantly in recent years as Fairfield County property values continue to appreciate. Jumbo loans—those exceeding conforming loan limits—are essential for financing luxury Connecticut properties. However, qualifying for jumbo financing requires understanding distinct requirements that differ substantially from conventional mortgages.

### What Makes a Loan "Jumbo" in Connecticut?

A jumbo mortgage is simply any residential mortgage exceeding the conforming loan limit. Conforming limits are set annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and represent the maximum loan amount that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase.

**2025-2026 Connecticut Conforming Loan Limits:**
- Single-family homes: $766,550
- High-cost areas: $833,450 (select Fairfield County areas)

Any mortgage above these limits is classified as "jumbo." Connecticut jumbo categories:

- **Standard Jumbo**: $766,550-$2,000,000
- **Super Jumbo**: $2,000,000-$5,000,000
- **Ultra Jumbo**: $5,000,000+ (portfolio lenders only)

Fairfield County properties frequently exceed $2M, particularly in Greenwich, Westport, Darien, and New Canaan. Understanding your property's classification helps identify available lender options and typical qualification requirements.

### Credit Score Requirements for Connecticut Jumbo Mortgages

Credit score is the first qualification hurdle for jumbo loans. Lenders use credit scores to assess borrower risk and determine pricing.

**Typical Credit Score Requirements:**

**Standard Jumbo Mortgages ($766K-$2M)**
- Minimum credit score: 700-720 (most lenders)
- Preferred credit score: 740+ (best rates)
- Score impact on rate: Each 20-point decrease typically costs 0.125%-0.250% in rate premium
- Compensating factors: Strong assets, significant down payment, or lower DTI may overcome lower scores

**Super Jumbo Mortgages ($2M-$5M+)**
- Minimum credit score: 720-740+ (stricter than standard jumbo)
- Preferred credit score: 750+ (ultra-competitive pricing)
- Portfolio lenders: May accept 700+ with strong compensating factors
- Asset-based qualification: High net worth may offset lower credit scores

**Portfolio vs Agency Credit Score Expectations:**
- Agency jumbo (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac): Typically 700-740+ minimum
- Portfolio lenders: May go to 680-700 range with compensating factors
- Wholesale brokers: Can access portfolio options for lower credit scores
- Rate impact: Portfolio programs sometimes price lower than agencies despite credit tier

**Credit Score Building Strategies (Before Jumbo Application):**
- Reduce revolving credit utilization to below 30% (immediate 20-30 point boost possible)
- Become authorized user on aged account with perfect payment history (30-50 point potential boost)
- Pay down recent delinquencies if any exist (payment history is 35% of score)
- Maintain current accounts; don't close old accounts (impacts average age of accounts)
- Allow 3-6 months for score improvement before applying (demonstrate sustained improvement)

### Debt-to-Income Requirements for Connecticut Jumbo Loans

Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio measures monthly debt payments against gross monthly income. Lenders use DTI to assess borrowing capacity and repayment ability.

**DTI Calculation Example:**

Monthly debts:
- Mortgage payment (proposed): $3,500
- Auto loan: $425
- Credit card minimum: $150
- Student loan: $275
- Child support/alimony: $0
- **Total monthly debt: $4,350**

Gross monthly income: $10,000

**DTI Ratio: 4,350 ÷ 10,000 = 43.5%**

**Typical Connecticut Jumbo DTI Limits:**

**Standard Jumbo ($766K-$2M)**
- Maximum DTI: 43% (traditional lenders)
- Maximum DTI with compensating factors: 45-50% (portfolio lenders)
- Lender preference: 40% or lower (best pricing)
- Calculation: Total monthly debts ÷ gross monthly income

**Super Jumbo ($2M-$5M+)**
- Maximum DTI: 40-43% (stricter than standard jumbo)
- Portfolio lenders: May reach 45-50% with exceptional assets
- Compensating factors importance: Increases with loan amount
- Asset-based qualification: High net worth may replace traditional DTI calculation

**Compensating Factors That Offset Higher DTI:**
- Significant liquid assets (6+ months reserves)
- Strong credit score (750+) with clean history
- Large down payment (30%+ for super jumbo)
- Substantial equity in other properties
- Stable, documented employment history
- Minimal debt outside mortgage (paid-off cars, credit cards)
- Professional licenses or certifications (CPA, MD, attorney)
- Proven business ownership with strong financials

**DTI Improvement Strategies:**
- Increase income: Demonstrate raise, bonus structure, or business growth with documentation
- Reduce debts: Aggressively pay down credit cards, auto loans, or student loans
- Time application: Wait if expecting income increase (raise, bonus, promotion) documented in tax returns
- Payment timing: Close credit accounts before application to remove small monthly minimums
- Business income: For self-employed, improve net business income through tax planning

### Down Payment Requirements for Connecticut Jumbo Mortgages

Down payment requirements increase with jumbo classification and borrower profile complexity.

**Down Payment Requirements by Loan Type:**

**Standard Jumbo Mortgages ($766K-$2M)**
- Minimum down payment: 20% (most lenders)
- Minimum down payment: 15% (some portfolio lenders)
- Loan-to-value (LTV) at 20% down: 80%
- LTV impact on rate: 80% LTV typical; higher LTV (85%) costs 0.250%-0.375% premium

**Super Jumbo Mortgages ($2M-$5M+)**
- Minimum down payment: 25-30% (most lenders)
- Minimum down payment: 20% (portfolio lenders with strong compensating factors)
- LTV at 25% down: 75%
- LTV impact: 75% LTV typical; 20% down (80% LTV) costs 0.375%-0.500% premium

**Investment Properties and Non-Owner-Occupied:**
- Minimum down payment: 25-30% (stricter than primary residence)
- Credit score requirements: Higher (740+) for investment property
- DTI limits: Stricter (40-43% maximum)
- Rate premium: Typically 0.375%-0.625% above owner-occupied

**Down Payment Source Requirements:**
- Personal savings (verification: 2 months bank statements)
- Gift funds (verification: gift letter, lender funds documentation)
- Investment account liquidation (verification: account statements)
- 401(k) loan (verification: plan documents, loan agreement)
- Sale of other property (verification: sales contract, settlement statement)
- Inherited funds (verification: will, death certificate, inheritance documentation)
- Business equity (verification: business tax returns, partner agreement)

### Income Documentation for Connecticut Jumbo Borrowers

Jumbo lenders scrutinize income documentation more carefully than conventional lenders, particularly for non-W-2 income sources.

**W-2 Employment Income Documentation:**
- Recent pay stubs (30-45 days current)
- 2 years W-2 forms (IRS 1040 Schedules)
- Verification of Employment (VOE) letter from employer
- Job letter confirming: Title, start date, income, likelihood of continued employment
- Income calculation: Average of 2 years' documented W-2 income or most recent year if higher
- Overtime/bonus income: Included only if documented last 2 years and likely to continue

**Self-Employed Income Documentation:**
- 2 years complete tax returns (personal + business, all schedules)
- 2 years business financial statements (profit & loss)
- 2 years business tax returns (1120-S, 1120-C, 1040 Schedule C)
- Current year profit & loss statement (month-to-date or quarter-to-date)
- CPA letter confirming income is accurate and continuing
- Bank statements supporting income deposits (6-12 months)

**Multiple Income Sources:**
- Documentation for each source (verification letters, tax returns)
- CPA letter if combining multiple sources for qualification
- 2-year history showing consistent income from each source
- Explanation of any income variations or changes
- Projected income if recent income source change

**Complex Income Situations:**
- Business ownership: Corporate returns, K-1 distributions, owner draws
- Investment income: Brokerage statements, dividend records, 1099 forms
- Rental property income: Lease agreements, bank statements, tax returns
- Bonus income: Signed bonus agreement and 2-year historical bonuses
- Commission income: Commission agreement and 2 years documented history
- Consulting/contract work: Contracts and 2 years documented income
- Alimony/child support income: Court order and 6-12 months bank documentation

**Income Calculation for Self-Employed:**
Most lenders average self-employed income over 2 years or use most recent year if higher. Example:

Year 1 income: $150,000
Year 2 income: $175,000
Average income: $162,500

If current year (partial) shows $200,000+ annual pace, some lenders use most recent 2-year average ($175,000) or project up to $200,000 if documented. Portfolio lenders may have greater flexibility.

### Assets and Reserves for Connecticut Jumbo Qualification

Beyond income, jumbo lenders evaluate total assets and liquid reserves to ensure repayment ability.

**Asset Documentation Requirements:**
- Liquid assets (bank accounts, money market, CDs): 6-12+ months mortgage payment reserve
- Investment accounts (brokerage, stocks, mutual funds): Monthly statements
- Retirement accounts (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA): Quarterly or recent statements
- Real estate equity (primary home, investment properties): Recent appraisal or comparable
- Business equity: Business tax returns and financial statements
- Vehicles and personal property: Typically excluded from asset calculations

**Reserve Requirements by Loan Type:**

**Standard Jumbo ($766K-$2M)**
- Minimum reserves: 3-6 months mortgage payment
- Typical reserves: 6 months mortgage payment
- Portfolio lenders: May accept 2-3 months with strong income documentation

**Super Jumbo ($2M-$5M+)**
- Minimum reserves: 6-12 months mortgage payment
- Typical reserves: 12+ months mortgage payment
- Asset-based qualifying: Assets may substitute for traditional income documentation

**Reserve Calculation Example:**

Proposed jumbo mortgage: $1,500,000
Interest rate: 5.5%
Loan term: 30 years
Estimated monthly payment: $8,522 (PITI + insurance)

Reserve requirements:
- 3-month reserve: $25,566
- 6-month reserve: $51,132
- 12-month reserve: $102,264

Borrower liquid assets required: $51,132-$102,264 (minimum 6-12 months for super jumbo)

**Asset Composition Strategies:**
- Prioritize liquid assets (bank accounts, money market) for reserve calculations
- Investment accounts acceptable but may have slight discount (20%) for volatility
- Retirement accounts harder to access but may count as backup reserves
- Primary residence equity counts but less preferred than liquid assets
- Business equity counts if documented with strong business financials
