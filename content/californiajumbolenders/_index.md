## Why California Jumbo Borrowers Need Specialized Lenders

California jumbo loans start at $1,149,825 (2025 high-balance conforming limit for most counties). Above that threshold, you're navigating portfolio lenders, private banks, and specialty programs with underwriting that agency lenders can't match. Tech worker with RSUs? Self-employed? Foreign national? Portfolio lenders hold loans instead of selling them—enabling manual underwriting, stock compensation treatment, and asset-based approval that rigid agency guidelines reject.

The challenge: most borrowers shop only 1–2 jumbo lenders and miss better rates, flexible terms, and stock-comp-friendly programs. Portfolio lenders compete aggressively in California's expensive markets (Bay Area, LA, San Diego, Orange County). Shopping 3–4 lenders uncovers relationship pricing, private banking discounts, and compensating factor flexibility that saves thousands monthly on multi-million-dollar loans.
