## Why California's Jumbo Limit Is Different (And Why It Matters)

California is one of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S.—and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the government-sponsored enterprises that buy most mortgages) recognize this. Instead of the baseline conforming loan limit of **$766,550** (2025), most California counties get a **high-balance conforming limit of $1,149,825**.

This isn't a small detail—it's a **rate, reserve, and approval advantage** that saves California buyers thousands annually. Understanding where the conforming limit ends and jumbo begins determines which lenders you shop, how much you'll pay in interest, and whether you need 6 months or 12 months of reserves.

### The Critical Threshold: $1,149,825 vs. $1,149,826

**If your loan is $1,149,825 or less** (in a high-cost California county), you qualify for **high-balance conforming financing**:
- **Lower rates** (0.125%–0.50% better than jumbo)
- **Lower reserve requirements** (6 months PITI vs. 9–12 months for jumbo)
- **Easier approval** (automated underwriting via Fannie/Freddie Desktop Underwriter)
- **More lender competition** (most banks, credit unions, and online lenders offer conforming)

**If your loan is $1,149,826 or more**, you need **jumbo financing**:
- **Higher rates** (0.125%–0.50% more than conforming, depending on credit/LTV)
- **Higher reserve requirements** (9–12 months PITI, sometimes 18+ for super-jumbo)
- **Manual underwriting** (portfolio lenders, private banks, stricter approval)
- **Fewer lenders** (not all lenders offer jumbo; shopping is critical)

**Example**: $1,720,000 purchase price, 20% down = **$1,376,000 loan**. This is a **jumbo loan** (above $1,149,825). If you increase down payment to 25% ($430,000), your loan becomes **$1,290,000**—still jumbo, but closer to the high-balance limit. If you can reduce the purchase price or increase down payment to get the loan under $1,149,825, you unlock conforming pricing and lower reserves.

## California Counties: Which Get the $1,149,825 Limit?

Not all California counties have the same conforming limit. **High-cost counties** (based on median home prices) get the elevated $1,149,825 limit. **Lower-cost counties** revert to the baseline $766,550 limit.

## High-Balance Conforming vs. Jumbo: Rate and Reserve Comparison

### **Scenario 1: $1,100,000 Loan (High-Balance Conforming)**
- **Loan amount**: $1,100,000 (under $1,149,825 limit)
- **Credit score**: 740
- **LTV**: 80% (20% down)
- **Rate**: 6.50% (conforming pricing)
- **Reserve requirement**: 6 months PITI (~$50K)
- **Monthly P&I**: $6,955
- **Total interest (30Y)**: $1.40M

### **Scenario 2: $1,400,000 Loan (Jumbo)**
- **Loan amount**: $1,400,000 (above $1,149,825 limit)
- **Credit score**: 740
- **LTV**: 80% (20% down)
- **Rate**: 6.875% (jumbo pricing, +0.375% vs. conforming)
- **Reserve requirement**: 9 months PITI (~$95K)
- **Monthly P&I**: $9,205
- **Total interest (30Y)**: $1.91M

**Jumbo premium**: $9,205 – $6,955 = **$2,250/month** (though loan is $300K larger). On a **per-$100K basis**, jumbo costs ~$35/month more due to higher rate.

**Reserve burden**: Jumbo requires **$45K more in reserves** ($95K vs. $50K)—meaningful for buyers with tight liquidity.

## Strategies to Stay Under the High-Balance Conforming Limit

### **1. Increase Down Payment**
If your loan is slightly over $1,149,825, increasing down payment can bring it under the limit.

**Example**: $1,720,000 purchase, 20% down = $1,376,000 loan (jumbo). Increase down payment to 25% ($430,000) → loan becomes $1,290,000 (still jumbo). Increase to 33% ($568,000) → loan becomes **$1,152,000** (still just over limit). **Increase to 35% ($602,000)** → loan becomes **$1,118,000** (high-balance conforming).

**Trade-off**: Putting $602K down vs. $344K down preserves **$258K in cash** but costs jumbo pricing (~0.375% higher rate). If you have liquidity and want better rates, maximizing down payment to stay conforming makes sense.

### **2. Reduce Purchase Price**
If you're shopping homes at $1,450,000–$1,500,000 (which trigger jumbo loans even at 20% down), consider homes at **$1,430,000 or less**. At 20% down, a $1,437,500 purchase = **$1,150,000 loan** (just over conforming). A $1,420,000 purchase = **$1,136,000 loan** (under conforming).

**Reality check**: In Bay Area, LA, and San Diego, $1.4M homes may be scarce or undesirable. But if you're on the margin, $20K–30K reduction in purchase price can save **$200–300/month** in interest.

### **3. Use Piggyback Second Mortgage (80-10-10 or 80-15-5)**
Some buyers use a **piggyback second mortgage** (home equity loan or HELOC) to keep the first mortgage under conforming limits.

**Example**: $1,600,000 purchase.
- **First mortgage**: $1,149,825 (80% of $1,437,281 adjusted value, conforming limit)
- **Second mortgage (HELOC)**: $130,175 (remaining balance to get to 80% LTV)
- **Down payment**: $320,000 (20%)

**Pros**: First mortgage gets conforming pricing (lower rate, lower reserves). Second mortgage is smaller, higher rate but only on a portion.

**Cons**: Two loans = two payments, two sets of closing costs. HELOC rates are variable (often Prime + 1%–2%, currently ~9%–10%). You'll need strong credit and income to qualify for both loans simultaneously.

**When this works**: If conforming rate is 6.50% and jumbo is 6.875%, the blended rate on conforming + HELOC may still beat straight jumbo—especially if you plan to pay off the HELOC quickly.

## When Jumbo Makes More Sense Than Conforming

### **1. You're Buying Well Above the Conforming Limit**
If your loan is $2M+, you're **deep into jumbo territory**. Trying to structure a conforming loan + massive second mortgage is impractical. Portfolio lenders and private banks offer better pricing and simpler underwriting for super-jumbo loans.

### **2. You Want Portfolio Lender Flexibility**
High-balance conforming loans follow **Fannie/Freddie underwriting guidelines**—automated, rigid, strict DTI caps. Jumbo portfolio lenders offer:
- **Manual underwriting** (compensating factors for high DTI, self-employment)
- **Stock compensation treatment** (Bay Area tech workers with RSUs)
- **Foreign national programs** (no U.S. credit required)
- **Asset-based underwriting** (asset depletion for high-net-worth borrowers)

If your income is complex (K-1, stock comp, self-employment) or you're a foreign national, **jumbo portfolio lenders may approve you when conforming lenders won't**—even if your loan is under $1,149,825.

### **3. Relationship Banking Discounts**
Private banks (J.P. Morgan, UBS, Northern Trust, Wells Fargo Private Bank) offer **relationship pricing** for jumbo clients who move deposits/investments to the bank. If you're moving $2M+ in assets, relationship discounts (0.25%–0.75% off jumbo rates) can beat conforming pricing—especially for loans just over the conforming limit.

**Example**: Conforming rate 6.50%, jumbo rate 6.875%. Move $3M to private bank → relationship discount 0.50% → jumbo rate becomes **6.375%** (beats conforming).

## High-Balance Conforming Loan Requirements (California)

Even though high-balance conforming loans get better pricing than jumbo, they still have **stricter requirements** than baseline conforming loans ($766,550 and under).

### **Credit Score**
- **Minimum**: 700 (some lenders require 720)
- **Best pricing**: 740+ (same as jumbo)
- **Penalty for 700–720**: +0.25%–0.50% rate adjustment

### **Down Payment**
- **Minimum**: 10% (some lenders require 15%–20% for high-balance)
- **Best pricing**: 20%+ (LTV ≤ 80%)
- **PMI required** if down payment < 20% (and PMI on high-balance conforming is expensive—0.50%–1.00% annually)

### **Debt-to-Income (DTI)**
- **Max DTI**: 43%–50% (automated underwriting allows higher DTI with compensating factors)
- **Ideal DTI**: 36% or lower for best pricing

### **Reserves**
- **Minimum**: 6 months PITI (some lenders require 9 months for high-balance)
- **Ideal**: 12+ months (improves approval odds and pricing)

### **Occupancy**
- **Primary residence**: Easiest approval, best pricing
- **Second home**: +0.50%–0.75% rate premium
- **Investment property**: +0.75%–1.50% rate premium

## Real Scenarios: Conforming vs. Jumbo in California

### **Scenario 1: Palo Alto Tech Worker, $1,600,000 Purchase**
- **Purchase price**: $1,600,000
- **Down payment**: 20% ($320,000)
- **Loan amount**: $1,280,000 (jumbo, above $1,149,825)
- **Credit**: 760
- **Income**: W-2 + RSUs (vested)

**Conforming option**: Not available (loan too large).

**Jumbo option**: Portfolio lender, 6.75% rate, 9 months reserves ($85K). **Monthly P&I**: $8,300.

**Optimization**: If buyer increases down payment to 28% ($448,000), loan becomes **$1,152,000** (still over conforming). To get under $1,149,825, buyer needs **28.1% down ($449,600)**. This preserves conforming pricing (6.50%) → **$7,280/month** P&I → **$1,020/month savings** vs. jumbo.

**Trade-off**: $129,600 extra down payment ($449,600 vs. $320,000) to save $1,020/month = **10.6-year breakeven**. If buyer plans to stay 10+ years, conforming wins. If buyer plans to move in 5–7 years, jumbo with lower down payment preserves liquidity.

### **Scenario 2: San Diego Foreign National, $2,000,000 Purchase**
- **Purchase price**: $2,000,000
- **Down payment**: 35% ($700,000)
- **Loan amount**: $1,300,000 (jumbo)
- **Credit**: No U.S. credit (strong foreign credit)
- **Reserves**: $400K liquid

**Conforming option**: Not available (foreign nationals need U.S. credit history for Fannie/Freddie loans).

**Jumbo option**: Portfolio lender, foreign national program, 7.25% rate, 18 months reserves. **Monthly P&I**: $8,870.

**Why jumbo wins**: Portfolio lenders approve foreign nationals; conforming lenders don't. Even if loan were under $1,149,825, buyer couldn't qualify for conforming without U.S. credit.

### **Scenario 3: Los Angeles Self-Employed, $1,100,000 Loan**
- **Purchase price**: $1,375,000
- **Down payment**: 20% ($275,000)
- **Loan amount**: $1,100,000 (under $1,149,825, high-balance conforming eligible)
- **Credit**: 720
- **Income**: Self-employed, inconsistent tax returns, strong bank statements

**Conforming option**: Automated underwriting (DU) declines due to self-employment income volatility and 48% DTI.

**Jumbo option**: Portfolio lender uses **bank statement income program** (12 months deposits), manually underwrites, approves at 6.875% with 9 months reserves.

**Why jumbo wins**: Even though loan is under conforming limit, **conforming lenders can't approve** due to rigid automated underwriting. Portfolio jumbo lender's manual underwriting is the only path to approval.

## Bottom Line: Know Your Limit, Optimize Your Loan Structure

California's **$1,149,825 high-balance conforming limit** is a massive advantage for buyers in expensive markets—but only if you structure your loan to stay under it. Key takeaways:

1. **Verify your county's limit** (not all California counties get $1,149,825).
2. **Model down payment scenarios** to see if you can drop under conforming limit (savings: 0.125%–0.50% rate).
3. **Compare conforming + HELOC vs. straight jumbo** if you're slightly over the limit.
4. **Shop portfolio jumbo lenders** if your income is complex (self-employed, stock comp, foreign national)—conforming may auto-decline you.
5. **Don't assume conforming is always better**: Relationship banking discounts and portfolio flexibility can make jumbo competitive.
