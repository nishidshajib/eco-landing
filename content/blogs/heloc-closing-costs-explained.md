## What Are HELOC Closing Costs?

When you open a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), you'll encounter various closing costs similar to those for a primary mortgage, though typically lower. Understanding these fees helps you budget accurately and negotiate better terms.

## Common HELOC Closing Costs

### 1. Application Fee
- **Typical Cost:** $75 - $200
- **What it covers:** Initial processing of your application
- **Negotiable:** Sometimes waived by lenders

### 2. Appraisal Fee
- **Typical Cost:** $300 - $500
- **What it covers:** Professional home valuation
- **Tip:** Some lenders offer appraisal waivers for excellent credit

### 3. Title Search and Insurance
- **Typical Cost:** $200 - $400
- **What it covers:** Verifying property ownership and protecting the lender
- **Required:** Usually mandatory

### 4. Attorney Fees
- **Typical Cost:** $500 - $1,000
- **What it covers:** Legal review and document preparation
- **Note:** Not required in all states

### 5. Recording Fees
- **Typical Cost:** $25 - $250
- **What it covers:** Filing the HELOC lien with local government
- **Fixed:** Set by county, non-negotiable

## How to Minimize Closing Costs

1. **Shop Multiple Lenders** - Compare total costs, not just rates
2. **Ask About Fee Waivers** - Many lenders waive fees for qualified borrowers
3. **Negotiate** - Application and processing fees are often negotiable
4. **Time Your Application** - Some lenders run promotional periods with reduced fees
5. **Consider No-Closing-Cost HELOCs** - Higher rate but $0 upfront costs

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Unusually high origination fees (over 2%)
- Hidden prepayment penalties
- Mandatory credit life insurance
- Annual fees over $100

## Final Thoughts

Total HELOC closing costs typically range from **$500 to $3,000**, significantly less than refinancing a primary mortgage. Always request a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) upfront and compare multiple offers before committing.
