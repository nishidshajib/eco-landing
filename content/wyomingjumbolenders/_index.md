Wyoming jumbo loans are most common in **Jackson Hole and other luxury markets**, where home prices frequently exceed the conforming loan limit of **$766,550**. These high-value properties often require specialized financing and lenders with experience in second homes, investment properties, and complex borrower profiles.
