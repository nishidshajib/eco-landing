Jumbo loans in Wyoming require stricter underwriting than conforming mortgages. Credit tiers, reserve requirements, and documentation standards determine both approval and pricing—especially in Jackson Hole and other luxury markets.

## Core Jumbo Underwriting Standards

### Credit Score Tiers

- **760+**: Best jumbo pricing and widest lender choice
- **740–759**: Slight rate adjustments (0.125%)
- **720–739**: Higher pricing and stricter reserves
- **700–719**: Portfolio lender or asset-based program often required
- **Below 700**: Limited jumbo options, higher rates

**Rate Impact Example** ($1.2M loan):
- 760 tier: $7,740/month
- 700 tier: $8,250/month
- **$510/month difference**

---

### Down Payment Requirements

- **Primary residence**: 20%–30% typical
- **Second home**: 25%–35% typical
- **Investment property**: 30%–40% common

**Portfolio programs** may allow 10%–15% down for strong borrowers with significant assets.

---

### Reserve Requirements

**Standard Jumbo**:
- 6–12 months reserves (PITI)

**Luxury/Portfolio Jumbo**:
- 12–24 months reserves (PITI)

**Second Homes**:
- Usually 12+ months reserves required

---

## Asset-Based Underwriting

### When Income Documentation Is Complex

Asset-based underwriting allows borrowers to qualify using liquid assets instead of traditional income.

**Common Asset Types**:
- Cash and savings
- Brokerage accounts
- Retirement accounts (discounted)
- Trust accounts

**Asset Depletion Formula**:
Total eligible assets ÷ 60 months = qualifying monthly income

**Example**:
$2,000,000 assets ÷ 60 = **$33,333/month income**

---

### Bank Statement Programs

Self-employed borrowers can qualify using 12–24 months bank statements instead of tax returns.

**Key Requirements**:
- Consistent deposits
- Business license or CPA letter
- Higher interest rates (0.50%–1.50% premium)

---

## DTI Requirements

Jumbo lenders generally require lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios:

- **Standard jumbo**: 38%–43% max DTI
- **Portfolio jumbo**: up to 45% DTI with strong assets
- **Asset-based**: DTI calculated from asset-derived income

**Tip**: Reduce monthly debt (auto loans, credit cards) before jumbo application to improve approval odds.

---

## Documentation Checklist

### Standard Jumbo Documentation

- 2 years W-2s or tax returns
- 2 months bank statements
- Asset account statements
- Verification of employment
- Government ID

### Asset-Based Documentation

- 2–3 months asset statements
- Proof of ownership of assets
- CPA letter (if applicable)
- Brokerage statements for non-retirement assets

---

## Wyoming-Specific Underwriting Considerations

### Jackson Hole Appraisal Complexity

Luxury appraisals require:
- Resort-market comparables
- Appraisers familiar with Teton County
- Time adjustments for seasonal sales

**Risk**: Generic lenders may undervalue property, causing loan denial or renegotiation.

---

### Rural Property + Jumbo

Large acreage properties above jumbo limit require:
- Portfolio lender expertise
- Manual underwriting
- Agricultural property valuation understanding

**Solution**: Use portfolio lenders or brokers with rural property jumbo access.

---

## Approval Strategies for Wyoming Jumbo Borrowers

### 1) Optimize Credit 60–90 Days Before Application

- Pay down revolving balances under 10% utilization
- Avoid new credit inquiries
- Dispute errors on credit report

### 2) Document Reserves Clearly

- Consolidate assets where possible
- Provide clean statements
- Identify liquid vs restricted assets

### 3) Compare Lenders for Flexibility

- Standard jumbo (best rates, strict requirements)
- Portfolio jumbo (flexibility, higher rates)
- Asset-based jumbo (flexibility, higher rates)

## Common Jumbo Underwriting Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Underestimating Reserve Requirements

Borrowers often focus on down payment but forget reserves. Jumbo lenders require **6–24 months of payments** in liquid reserves.

### Pitfall 2: Relying on One Lender

Underwriting guidelines differ—one lender may decline while another approves the same scenario.

### Pitfall 3: Complex Income Without Proper Documentation

Self-employed borrowers should prepare CPA letters and clear bank statements to support income.

Wyoming jumbo underwriting is stricter, but approval is possible with preparation.

**Key Takeaways**:
- 760+ credit scores unlock best jumbo pricing
- Reserve requirements are significant (6–24 months)
