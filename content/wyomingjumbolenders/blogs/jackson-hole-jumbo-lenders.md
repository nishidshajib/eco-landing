Jackson Hole is one of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S., with most properties exceeding $1M. Jumbo loans are standard here, but **lender expertise varies dramatically**, making specialized lender selection essential.

## Why Jackson Hole Jumbo Lending Is Different

### 1) Luxury Market Pricing

- Median home price: **$2.5M+**
- Loan sizes commonly $1M–$5M+
- Lender fees and pricing vary widely

**Rate Impact**: 0.25%–0.50% pricing gaps are common.

---

### 2) Resort-Market Appraisals

Appraisers must understand:
- Resort-market comparables
- Seasonal buyer demand
- Luxury amenity valuation (ski access, views)

**Why It Matters**: Appraisal accuracy can make or break jumbo approvals.

---

### 3) Complex Borrower Profiles

Many Jackson Hole buyers are:
- Business owners with complex income
- High-net-worth investors
- Second-home or vacation property buyers

Standard jumbo programs can decline these borrowers without asset-based underwriting flexibility.

## Jackson Hole Jumbo Lender Types

### Luxury-Focused Jumbo Lenders

**Best For**: Primary luxury and resort properties

**Strengths**:
- High loan limits ($3M–$10M+)
- Asset-based underwriting options
- Appraisers with resort-market expertise

**Examples**:
- Guaranteed Rate (luxury division)
- CrossCountry Mortgage (high-net-worth programs)
- Chase Private Client lending

---

### Portfolio Lenders

**Best For**: Unique properties and non-standard income

**Strengths**:
- Manual underwriting flexibility
- Can accept rural or unique properties

**Trade-Off**:
- Higher rates (0.25%–0.75% premium)
- Potentially higher fees

---

### National Jumbo Programs

**Best For**: Standard high-credit borrowers

**Strengths**:
- Competitive pricing for 760+ credit
- Fast approvals for clean files

**Limitations**:
- Less flexibility on appraisals and complex income
- Less familiarity with Jackson Hole comps

---

## Underwriting Requirements for Jackson Hole Jumbo

### Typical Credit Standards

- 760+ for best pricing
- 740–759 for strong approvals
- 720–739 may require higher reserves
- Below 700 usually requires portfolio lender

### Down Payment Requirements

- 20%–30% standard
- 10%–15% possible with strong reserves and asset-based underwriting

### Reserve Requirements

- 6–12 months for primary residence
- 12–24 months for second homes or luxury properties

---

## Asset-Based Jumbo Options

### When Income Documentation Is Complex

High-net-worth borrowers can qualify without traditional W-2s:

- **Asset depletion**: Convert liquid assets into qualifying monthly income
- **Bank statement loans**: 12–24 months business/personal bank statements
- **Pledged asset lines**: Collateralized lending for investment-heavy clients

These options are common in Jackson Hole due to high concentrations of self-employed and investor buyers.

---

## Fee and APR Differences

### Why APR Matters More in Jackson Hole

Jumbo lender fees often exceed $15,000–$30,000 on $1.5M+ loans.

**APR Example**:
- Lender A: 6.50% rate, $25,000 fees → 6.85% APR
- Lender B: 6.625% rate, $10,000 fees → 6.80% APR

**Insight**: Lender B has higher rate but lower APR (true cost advantage).

## Jackson Hole Jumbo Shopping Strategy

### Step 1: Identify Property Type

- Primary residence
- Second home
- Investment property

Loan pricing varies by occupancy type—second homes and investment properties typically carry higher rates and reserve requirements.

---

### Step 2: Compare 3–5 Lenders

Include:
- Luxury-focused jumbo lender
- Portfolio lender
- National jumbo lender

---

### Step 3: Verify Appraisal Expertise

Ask: "Do you use appraisers experienced with Jackson Hole/Teton County luxury homes?"

**Red Flag**: Lender cannot confirm local appraisal expertise.

---

### Step 4: Compare APR and Fees

Request Loan Estimates and compare:
- Rate
- APR
- Origination fees
- Points/credits

---

## Common Jackson Hole Jumbo Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using a Generic Jumbo Lender

Generic national lenders may not understand Jackson Hole comps, leading to appraisal issues or conservative valuations.

**Solution**: Use luxury-focused lenders with resort-market expertise.

---

### Mistake 2: Ignoring APR

Higher fees can offset lower rates. APR reveals true cost.

**Solution**: Compare APR and total fees, not just interest rate.

---

### Mistake 3: Underestimating Reserve Requirements

Luxury lenders may require 12–24 months reserves. Borrowers unaware may be delayed or denied.

**Solution**: Ask reserve requirements early and document assets clearly.

---

### Mistake 4: Assuming 20% Down Is Enough

Some Jackson Hole lenders require 25%–30% down for second homes or investment properties.

**Solution**: Verify occupancy-based down payment requirements.

---

## Bottom Line

Jackson Hole jumbo lending is specialized. Lender expertise, appraisal experience, and underwriting flexibility **matter more than the headline rate**.

**Best Practices**:
- Use luxury-focused lenders with resort-market expertise
- Compare 3–5 lenders, including portfolio options
- Focus on APR and total fees
- Confirm appraisal expertise and reserve requirements
