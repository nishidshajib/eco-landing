Wyoming's conforming loan limit sets the line between standard mortgage pricing and jumbo financing. In luxury markets like Jackson Hole, most properties exceed the conforming limit, making jumbo lending the default option.

## 2026 Wyoming Conforming Loan Limit

**Base conforming limit**: $766,550

**Jumbo definition**: Any loan amount **above** the conforming limit

**High-balance exceptions**: Select counties may have higher limits in some years, but **most Wyoming counties remain at the base limit**.

> If your loan amount is $766,551 or higher, it is a jumbo loan.

## Why Loan Limits Matter

### 1) Rate Differences

Jumbo rates are often **0.125%–0.375% higher** than conforming rates, but specialized jumbo lenders can sometimes match or beat conforming pricing for high-credit borrowers.

### 2) Underwriting Differences

Jumbo loans typically require:
- Higher credit scores (740+ preferred)
- Larger down payments (20%–30%)
- Stronger reserve requirements (6–12+ months)

### 3) Fee Differences

Jumbo lender fees are higher. **APR comparison** reveals true cost—on $1.5M loans, fee differences can exceed $10,000.

## Wyoming Market Impact

## Jumbo vs High-Balance: What's the Difference?

### High-Balance Conforming

Some markets allow **higher-than-standard conforming limits** (high-balance). These loans still follow conforming rules and often have lower rates than jumbo loans.

**Wyoming reality**: Most counties remain at base limit. Always verify if your county qualifies.

### Jumbo Loans

Loans above conforming limits require jumbo underwriting standards and are not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

- **Conforming loan**
- Eligible for standard rates

### Example 2: $900,000 Loan (Cheyenne)

- Above $766,550

## Jumbo Pricing Differences

### Why Lender Comparison Matters

Two jumbo lenders can quote rates **0.25%–0.50% apart**.

**Example** ($1.5M loan):
- 6.50% vs 7.00% = **$500/month** difference
- **$6,000/year** cost difference

APR comparisons reveal the full cost including fees.
