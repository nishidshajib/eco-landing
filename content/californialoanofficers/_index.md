California's mortgage landscape is the most complex in the nation—$1.149M high-balance conforming limits, CalHFA down payment assistance, Prop 13 portability, stock compensation underwriting for tech workers, and jumbo loans that dominate expensive markets. Choosing the right loan officer makes the difference between approval and denial, competitive pricing and overpaying, and smooth closings versus last-minute disasters.

The challenge: most borrowers work with the first loan officer their real estate agent refers, missing rate differences of 0.25%–0.50% ($200–$500/month on California's median loan). Loan officers vary wildly in expertise—some specialize in first-time buyers and CalHFA programs, others in jumbo loans and stock comp underwriting, and many lack knowledge of California-specific programs that save thousands.
