## Why California Loan Programs Matter for Loan Officers

California has **the most complex mortgage landscape** in the United States:

- **Highest median home price** ($800K statewide, $1.5M+ in Bay Area/coastal cities)
- **Most down payment assistance programs** (50+ state/county/city programs)
- **Unique property tax rules** (Prop 13, Prop 19, Prop 60/90)
- **Highest conforming loan limits** ($1,149,825 in most counties)
- **Strictest environmental/disclosure laws** (earthquake zones, fire zones, coastal commission)

**Loan officers who don't understand California-specific programs leave massive money on the table** for borrowers—and lose deals to competitors who do.

This guide covers **every major California program loan officers must know** to serve first-time buyers, move-up buyers, retirees, and high-income earners across the state.

## 1. CalHFA Down Payment Assistance Programs

**CalHFA** (California Housing Finance Agency) is the state agency that administers **down payment assistance** (DPA) and **affordable first mortgages** for low-to-moderate income California buyers.

### **CalHFA MyHome Assistance Program (Most Popular)**

**What it is**: Deferred-payment junior loan (silent second mortgage) for **3%–3.5% of purchase price** to cover down payment and/or closing costs.

**Key details**:
- **Loan amount**: 3% (conventional) or 3.5% (FHA) of purchase price
- **Interest rate**: 0% (no monthly payment)
- **Repayment**: Deferred until you **sell, refi, or pay off first mortgage** (then CalHFA gets repaid in full)
- **No monthly payment**: Silent second—you only pay first mortgage P&I
- **Forgiveness**: **None** (must repay full amount when loan is satisfied)

**Income limits** (varies by county):
- **Low-income counties** (Fresno, Bakersfield, Inland Empire): $150K–180K household income
- **High-cost counties** (LA, SF, SD, Orange, Santa Clara): $200K–230K household income

**Purchase price limits**:
- Tied to **FHA loan limits** (varies by county)
- **Most counties**: $806,500 (standard conforming limit)
- **High-cost counties**: $1,149,825 (SF, LA, Orange, San Diego, Santa Clara, Marin, San Mateo)

**Credit score**: 660+ (conventional), 640+ (FHA)

**Down payment**:
- Conventional: 3% down (CalHFA provides 3%, borrower brings 0%)
- FHA: 3.5% down (CalHFA provides 3.5%, borrower brings 0%)

**First-time buyer requirement**: **Yes** (must not have owned home in past 3 years, except military veterans)

**Example scenario**:
- Purchase price: $700K (Los Angeles)
- Loan program: Conventional 97% LTV + CalHFA MyHome
- CalHFA assistance: 3% of $700K = **$21,000** (silent second)
- Borrower down payment: **$0** (CalHFA covers full 3%)
- First mortgage: $679,000 (97% LTV)
- Monthly payment: $4,760 (first mortgage only, no CalHFA payment)
- Repayment: When borrower sells/refis, pays back $21K to CalHFA (no interest)

**Loan officer value**: Borrowers who have **$10K–15K saved** (not enough for 3% down + closing costs) can buy with **zero down** using CalHFA. Closing costs can be **seller-paid or lender credits**.

---

### **CalHFA Zero Interest Program (ZIP)**

**What it is**: Deferred-payment junior loan for **up to $15,000** (or 3% of sales price, whichever is less) for down payment/closing costs.

**Key differences from MyHome**:
- **Fixed dollar cap**: $15K max (vs. MyHome 3% of price)
- **Best for lower-priced homes**: If 3% of price is >$15K, use MyHome. If 3% is <$15K, ZIP and MyHome are identical.

**Example**:
- $400K purchase: 3% = $12K → ZIP and MyHome both provide $12K
- $800K purchase: 3% = $24K → MyHome provides $24K, ZIP caps at $15K → **Use MyHome**

**Most loan officers ignore ZIP** because MyHome is always equal or better.

---

### **CalHFA Extra Credit Teacher Home Purchase Program (ECTP)**

**What it is**: Enhanced DPA for **California public school teachers, administrators, and staff**.

**Assistance amount**: **4% of purchase price** (vs. 3% for standard buyers)

**Who qualifies**:
- Employed by California public school district (K–12)
- Teachers, administrators, counselors, librarians, staff
- Must work **full-time** (part-time teachers don't qualify)

**Income/price limits**: Same as MyHome

**Example**:
- $650K purchase, teacher buyer
- CalHFA ECTP: 4% of $650K = **$26,000** (silent second)
- Borrower down payment: **$0**
- First mortgage: $624,000 (96% LTV)

**Loan officer value**: If you work with teachers (huge market in California—300K+ public school employees), **always mention ECTP** (extra $6,500–10,000 vs. standard MyHome).

---

### **CalHFA Forgivable Equity Builder Loan (FEBL)**

**What it is**: Forgivable junior loan that **disappears after 5 years** if you stay in the home.

**Assistance amount**: **10% of purchase price** (up to $150,000)

**Forgiveness**: **20%/year over 5 years**
- Year 1: Owe 100%
- Year 2: Owe 80%
- Year 3: Owe 60%
- Year 4: Owe 40%
- Year 5: Owe 20%
- Year 6+: **$0 owed** (fully forgiven)

**Interest rate**: 0% (no monthly payment)

**Who qualifies**:
- **First-time buyers** (no home ownership in 3 years)
- **Income limits**: Lower than MyHome (typically $100K–130K household income, varies by county)
- **Purchase price limits**: $500K–650K (varies by county)

**Credit score**: 660+

**Loan officer value**: Best for **low-income first-time buyers** who plan to **stay 5+ years** (forgiveness = free money). If client might move in 3 years, **MyHome is better** (FEBL requires partial repayment if you sell early).

**Example**:
- $550K purchase, first-time buyer, $110K household income
- CalHFA FEBL: 10% of $550K = **$55,000** (silent second)
- First mortgage: $495,000 (90% LTV)
- Borrower stays 5 years → **FEBL fully forgiven** (free $55K down payment)
- Borrower stays 3 years, sells → owes 60% of $55K = **$33K repayment** (still got $22K free)

## 2. California Dream For All Shared Appreciation Loan

**Dream For All** is California's newest down payment assistance program (launched 2023)—offers **20% down payment assistance** in exchange for **20% equity share** when you sell.

### **How Dream For All Works**

**Assistance amount**: **20% of purchase price** (silent second mortgage)

**Interest rate**: **0%** (no monthly payment)

**Repayment**: When you **sell or refinance**, you repay:
- **20% of original loan amount** ($100K if you borrowed $100K)
- **+ 20% of home appreciation** (if home appreciated)

**Example 1: Home appreciates**
- Purchase price: $600K
- Dream For All assistance: 20% of $600K = **$120K**
- Borrower down payment: **$0** (or 0.5%–1% for closing costs)
- First mortgage: $480K (80% LTV)
- Home sells after 5 years for **$750K** (25% appreciation)
- Dream For All repayment: **$120K (original loan) + $30K (20% of $150K appreciation) = $150K**
- Net profit: $750K sale price – $480K first mortgage payoff – $150K Dream For All repayment = **$120K profit** (borrower keeps 80% of appreciation)

**Example 2: Home depreciates**
- Purchase price: $600K
- Dream For All assistance: $120K
- Home sells after 3 years for **$550K** (8.3% depreciation)
- Dream For All repayment: **$120K (original loan) – $10K (20% of $50K loss) = $110K**
- Dream For All absorbs 20% of loss—borrower only repays $110K (not full $120K)

**Who qualifies**:
- **First-time buyers** (no home ownership in 3 years)
- **Income limits**: $250K household income (higher than CalHFA)
- **Purchase price limits**: Up to $1,000,000 (statewide)
- **Credit score**: 680+

**Loan officer value**:
- **Best for high-income first-time buyers** (who earn $200K+ but have low savings due to student loans, stock comp vesting schedules, or Bay Area rent)
- **Not ideal for low-appreciation markets** (if home appreciates 2%/year, borrower shares 20% of minimal gains)
- **Risk**: If home appreciates 50%, borrower gives up **20% of equity** (which could be $100K+ in Bay Area)

**Example: Tech worker in San Jose**
- Household income: $220K (high for CalHFA, but qualifies for Dream For All)
- Purchase price: $950K
- Dream For All: 20% of $950K = **$190K down payment**
- First mortgage: $760K
- Borrower brings: **$0 down** (closing costs covered by lender credits or seller)
- 5 years later, home worth $1.3M (37% appreciation)
- Dream For All repayment: $190K + 20% of $350K appreciation = **$190K + $70K = $260K**
- Borrower keeps: $1.3M – $760K (mortgage payoff) – $260K (Dream For All) = **$280K profit**

**Dream For All vs. CalHFA**:
- **Dream For All**: Higher assistance (20% vs. 3%), higher income limits ($250K vs. $200K), but **must share appreciation**
- **CalHFA MyHome**: Lower assistance (3%), lower income limits, but **no appreciation sharing** (only repay principal)

---

## 3. Proposition 13 and Property Tax Portability (Prop 19)

**Proposition 13** (passed 1978) is California's constitutional limit on property tax increases:

- **Initial assessed value** = purchase price
- **Annual increase cap** = 2%/year max (even if market value rises 10%/year)
- **Reassessment** only when property sells (new owner pays tax on new purchase price)

**Why this matters for loan officers**: California homeowners who bought **10–30 years ago** have **massive property tax savings** (paying taxes on $300K assessed value even though home is worth $1.5M today). They **fear moving** because new purchase triggers reassessment → 3x–5x higher property tax bill.

### **Proposition 19 (Tax Portability for Seniors 55+)**

**Prop 19** (passed 2020, effective 2021) allows homeowners **age 55+, disabled, or wildfire/disaster victims** to **transfer their old property tax base** to a new home **anywhere in California** (previously limited to same county or 10 specific counties).

**How Prop 19 works**:

**Old rule (Prop 60/90, pre-2021)**:
- Homeowner age 55+ could transfer tax base **once in lifetime**
- Only within **same county** (or to 10 approved counties: LA, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, El Dorado, Riverside, San Bernardino)
- New home must be **equal or lesser value** than old home

**New rule (Prop 19, 2021+)**:
- Homeowner age 55+ can transfer tax base **up to 3 times in lifetime**
- Transfer to **any county in California** (not limited to same county)
- New home can be **any value** (if new home is more expensive, assessed value is adjusted upward proportionally)

**Example 1: Equal-value purchase**
- Current home: Purchased 1990 for $200K, now worth $1.2M, assessed value $300K (Prop 13 cap)
- Property tax: $300K × 1.2% = **$3,600/year**
- Sells for $1.2M, buys new home for $1.2M (equal value)
- Prop 19 transfer: New home assessed at **$300K** (old tax base transfers)
- New property tax: **$3,600/year** (same as before)
- **Savings vs. no portability**: $1.2M × 1.2% = $14,400/year → saves **$10,800/year** by transferring tax base

**Example 2: Move-up purchase (new home more expensive)**
- Current home: Assessed value $400K, sells for $1M
- Buys new home for $1.5M (50% more expensive)
- Prop 19 formula: $400K (old base) + $500K (difference in purchase price) = **$900K assessed value**
- New property tax: $900K × 1.2% = **$10,800/year**
- **Savings vs. no portability**: $1.5M × 1.2% = $18,000/year → saves **$7,200/year**

**Loan officer value**:
- **Unlock senior move-up buyers** who were "stuck" in old homes (feared tax increases). Prop 19 allows them to **buy larger/better homes** (move closer to grandkids, downsize to single-story, relocate to wine country) **without losing tax benefits**.
- **Target markets**: Retirees moving from Bay Area to Tahoe, Sacramento, San Diego (tax base transfers).
- **Marketing angle**: "You can move anywhere in California and keep your low property taxes" (huge selling point for 55+ buyers).

## 4. High-Balance Conforming Loan Limits (California-Specific)

**Standard conforming limit** (2024): **$766,550** (nationwide)

**High-balance conforming limit** (2024): **$1,149,825** (California high-cost counties)

**California counties with $1,149,825 limit** (most populous):
- Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino
- San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin
- Ventura, Sacramento, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Napa

**Why this matters**: Loans up to **$1,149,825** are **conforming** (Fannie/Freddie) → lower rates, easier underwriting, 3%–5% down options. **Above $1,149,825 = jumbo** → stricter guidelines, 10%–20% down, higher rates.

**Example**:
- $1.1M purchase in San Jose (Santa Clara County)
- **Conforming loan**: 5% down ($55K), rate 6.50%, conventional 95% LTV
- If this were in Fresno (standard $766,550 limit), **$1.1M = jumbo** → 20% down ($220K), rate 6.875%, much harder to qualify

**Loan officer value**: Know which counties have high-balance limits. Borrowers buying $800K–1.1M homes in California **expect conforming treatment** (5% down, competitive rates). If you mistakenly treat as jumbo, **you lose the deal** to a loan officer who knows better.

---

## 5. Regional/Local Down Payment Assistance Programs

California has **50+ county/city DPA programs** (beyond CalHFA). Loan officers must know local programs in their markets.

### **Los Angeles County**

**LA County Development Authority (LACDA) Home Ownership Program**:
- **Assistance**: 3% down payment loan (deferred, 0% interest)
- **Income limits**: $110K–130K household
- **Purchase price**: Up to $650K
- **Credit**: 640+

### **San Francisco**

**SF Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD)**:
- **Down Payment Assistance Loan Program (DALP)**: Up to $375,000 (yes, $375K!) for low-income buyers
- **Income limits**: $120K–150K household (strict)
- **Purchase price**: Up to $1M (condos/townhomes)
- **Repayment**: Deferred until sale/refi, **shared appreciation** (city takes % of equity)

### **San Diego**

**San Diego Housing Commission**:
- **First-Time Homebuyer Program**: Up to $30,000 DPA (silent second, 0% interest)
- **Income limits**: $150K household
- **Purchase price**: Up to $950K
- **Credit**: 680+

### **Orange County**

**Orange County Housing Authority**:
- **First-Time Homebuyer Program**: 3% DPA (deferred, 0% interest)
- **Income limits**: $130K–160K household
- **Purchase price**: Up to $800K

### **Inland Empire (Riverside/San Bernardino)**

**Inland Empire Homeownership Programs**:
- **Assistance**: $10K–20K DPA (deferred)
- **Income limits**: $100K household
- **Purchase price**: Up to $500K

**Loan officer value**: Layer CalHFA (state program) + local DPA = **$25K–50K total assistance**. Example: LA buyer uses CalHFA $21K + LACDA $20K = **$41K down payment** (borrower brings $0).

---

## 6. California First-Time Buyer Tax Credit (FTHB)

**Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)**: California offers **federal tax credit** (not deduction—actual dollar-for-dollar reduction in taxes owed) for first-time buyers.

**How MCC works**:
- Buyer gets **20%–30% of annual mortgage interest** back as tax credit
- Example: Pay $20K mortgage interest/year, 20% MCC = **$4,000 tax credit** (reduces federal taxes owed by $4K)
- Credit is **annual** (every year you have the mortgage)
- **Lifetime value**: $4K/year × 10 years = **$40K in tax savings**

**Who qualifies**:
- First-time buyers (no home ownership in 3 years)
- Income limits: $150K–200K household (varies by county)
- Purchase price limits: $800K–1.1M (varies by county)

**Trade-off**: MCC **reduces mortgage interest deduction** (you can't double-dip—if you claim $4K MCC credit, you deduct $16K interest instead of $20K). But **credit > deduction** for most buyers (saves more taxes).

**Loan officer value**: **Every first-time buyer** should evaluate MCC. Combine with CalHFA → buyer gets **DPA + tax credits** (stacks perfectly). Apply through county housing authority (not all counties offer—check local).

---

## 7. California Environmental/Disclosure Requirements Loan Officers Must Know

### **Natural Hazard Disclosure (NHD)**

California requires sellers to disclose **natural hazard zones**:
- **Earthquake fault zones** (Alquist-Priolo zones)
- **Flood zones** (FEMA maps)
- **Fire hazard zones** (Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones—VHFHSZ)
- **Tsunami/seiche zones** (coastal areas)

**Loan officer impact**: Lenders require **hazard insurance** (earthquake, flood, fire) if property is in high-risk zone. Some lenders **won't lend** in extreme fire zones (Paradise, areas burned in 2017–2023 fires).

**What to do**: Check NHD report early (order with appraisal). If property is in fire zone, **confirm lender will accept** + verify insurance availability (some insurers pulled out of California fire zones).

### **Coastal Commission Approval**

Properties within **California Coastal Zone** (within ~1 mile of coast) require **Coastal Development Permits** for major renovations. Lenders may require **Coastal Commission approval** for condition/title clearance.

**Loan officer impact**: Delays closings (Coastal Commission reviews take 30–90 days). If buyer plans renovation, **flag this upfront**.

---

## 8. California Self-Employed/1099 Loan Programs

California has **highest concentration of self-employed workers** in U.S. (gig economy, tech contractors, real estate agents, freelancers). Standard Fannie/Freddie loans require **2 years tax returns**, which often understate income (write-offs, depreciation).

**California-specific solutions**:

### **Bank Statement Loans**

Qualify based on **12–24 months business/personal bank deposits** (instead of tax returns).

**Example**:
- Borrower: Freelance graphic designer
- Tax returns show $80K income (after write-offs)
- Bank statements show $150K deposits/year (gross revenue)
- Bank statement lender qualifies at **$150K income** (or 50%–75% of deposits, depending on lender)

**Rates**: 6.75%–7.50% (0.25%–0.75% higher than conventional)

**Down payment**: 10%–15% min (vs. 3% conventional)

**Lenders**: Angel Oak, Deephaven, Acra, Verus (brokers access these; banks typically don't)

### **1099 Income Loans**

Qualify using **1099 forms** (instead of full tax returns).

**Example**:
- Tech contractor, $180K on 1099s
- Tax returns show $120K (after home office, mileage, equipment write-offs)
- 1099 lender qualifies at **$180K gross income**

**Loan officer value**: California self-employed buyers **expect you to know non-QM options**. If you say "sorry, your tax returns don't show enough income," they'll find a broker who does bank statement loans.

---

## 9. Stock Compensation Underwriting (Bay Area/LA Tech Hubs)

California tech workers receive **30%–60% of comp as stock** (RSUs, options, ESPP). Fannie/Freddie allow stock comp as income, but **underwriting varies wildly** by lender.

**Stock comp types**:

### **RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)**

**Vested RSUs**: Count as income (most lenders require 2 years history, average vested amounts)

**Unvested RSUs**: Some lenders count **50% of unvested** (if vesting within 12 months). Others count 0%.

**Example**:
- Base salary: $150K
- RSUs vesting in 2024: $100K
- Some lenders qualify at **$150K + $100K = $250K**
- Others qualify at **$150K only** (don't count unvested)

### **Stock Options (ISOs/NSOs)**

Most lenders **don't count** until exercised and sold (too speculative). Exception: **Post-IPO companies with liquid stock** (e.g., Google, Meta, Apple employees—lenders count as regular income).

### **ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan)**

If borrower has **2 years history** of ESPP participation + selling shares, lenders count as **bonus income** (average sales over 2 years).

**Loan officer value**: **Bay Area/LA loan officers MUST understand stock comp**. If you say "we can't count your RSUs," borrower finds another loan officer who can. Partner with **jumbo lenders who specialize in tech workers** (First Republic—RIP—used to dominate this; now UWM, Pennymac, and portfolio lenders fill gap).

---

## 10. California Refinance Programs (Cash-Out Restrictions)

### **Prop 58/193 Parent-Child Transfer Exclusion (Eliminated 2021)**

**Old rule (pre-2021)**: Parents could transfer primary residence to children **without property tax reassessment** (child inherited parent's low Prop 13 tax base).

**New rule (Prop 19, 2021+)**: Parent-child transfer **triggers reassessment UNLESS**:
- Child uses home as **primary residence** (must move in within 1 year)
- Home value <**$1M above assessed value** (if parent's assessed value is $300K and home worth $1.3M, no reassessment; if worth $1.5M, reassessed on $200K excess)

**Loan officer impact**: Fewer parent-child transfers (tax penalty). If child wants to keep home, **must qualify for mortgage** (can't assume parent's loan if child doesn't live there). Plan for **refinance** if child inherits.

### **California Cash-Out Refi (Fannie/Freddie)**

California is **"non-recourse" state** for purchase loans (lender can't pursue borrower personally if foreclosed—can only take property). But **cash-out refis are recourse** (lender can sue for deficiency if underwater).

**Loan officer value**: Explain to borrowers that **cash-out refi = recourse loan** (you lose non-recourse protection from original purchase). Some borrowers prefer **HELOC instead** (keeps first mortgage non-recourse, second mortgage is recourse but smaller loan).

---

## Red Flags: When Loan Officers Lose California Deals

❌ **Don't know CalHFA exists**: Borrower has $15K saved, needs $21K down. You say "sorry, not enough." Competitor mentions CalHFA, closes deal.

❌ **Don't know Prop 19**: 60-year-old client says "I can't move, my property taxes will triple." You agree. Competitor explains Prop 19, shows $7K/year savings, closes $1.5M deal.

❌ **Don't know high-balance conforming limits**: Borrower buying $1.1M home in LA. You quote jumbo (20% down, 6.875%). Competitor quotes conforming (5% down, 6.50%). You lose.

❌ **Don't know bank statement loans**: Self-employed borrower, tax returns show $90K. You decline. Competitor does bank statement loan (qualifies at $140K), closes deal.

❌ **Don't know stock comp underwriting**: Tech worker, $200K salary + $150K RSUs. You qualify at $200K only (debt ratios don't work). Competitor counts RSUs, qualifies at $350K, closes $1.8M jumbo.

---

## Bottom Line: California Loan Officers Must Specialize

California is **not a generic mortgage market**. Loan officers who treat it like Texas, Florida, or Arizona **lose deals daily** to California specialists who know:

✅ **CalHFA** (3% DPA, ECTP for teachers, FEBL forgiveness)  
✅ **Dream For All** (20% DPA, appreciation sharing)  
✅ **Prop 19** (tax portability for 55+)  
✅ **High-balance conforming** ($1,149,825 limits in most counties)  
✅ **Local DPA** (LA, SF, SD, OC, IE programs)  
✅ **Bank statement loans** (self-employed, 1099, gig workers)  
✅ **Stock comp underwriting** (RSUs, options, ESPP)  
✅ **Natural hazard zones** (fire, flood, earthquake insurance)
