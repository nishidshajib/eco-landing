Shopping for a mortgage without comparing lenders is like buying a car from the first dealership you visit—you'll probably overpay. Most homebuyers contact their current bank, get quoted a rate, and assume that's the market. Meanwhile, credit unions are offering 0.25% lower rates, mortgage brokers are accessing wholesale pricing another 0.375% below that, and online lenders are waiving $2,000 in fees the big bank charges.

MTGLenders helps you compare banks, credit unions, brokers, and online lenders across the factors that matter: [rate competitiveness](https://browselenders.com/rates), credit score requirements, program availability, fees transparency, and real borrower reviews. Not all lenders offer the same programs—some specialize in FHA loans for lower credit scores, others dominate VA lending, and many don't advertise their [cash-out refinance programs](https://cash-outrefinance.com) at all.

The right lender isn't just about the lowest rate—it's about approval odds, closing speed, and service quality. We help you evaluate lenders for [middle-range credit scores](https://middlecreditscore.com) who need flexible underwriting, first-time buyers navigating program decisions, and homeowners comparing [refinance lenders](https://cash-outrefinance.com/compare) for best terms.
