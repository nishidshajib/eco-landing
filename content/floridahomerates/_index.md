**Florida mortgage rates** education helps borrowers understand how rates are priced and how to compare lenders without falling for misleading advertised rates. Your credit score, loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, and loan program all affect pricing. Florida lenders price rates in tiers, and transparent rate shopping means requesting personalized Loan Estimates from multiple lenders—not chasing teaser rates.
