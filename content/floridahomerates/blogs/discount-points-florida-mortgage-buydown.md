Lender offers you 6.75% with zero points, or 6.50% if you pay $3,000 upfront. Should you buy the rate down? It depends on how long you'll keep the loan. Here's how discount points work and when they make sense.

## What Discount Points Actually Are

A discount point is a fee you pay upfront to "buy down" your interest rate. One point equals 1% of your loan amount.

**Example on a $300,000 Loan:**
- 1 point = $3,000
- 2 points = $6,000
- 0.5 points = $1,500

Paying points lowers your rate, which lowers your monthly payment. But you're paying thousands upfront to save hundreds monthly—so you need to keep the loan long enough to break even.

## How Much Does Each Point Lower Your Rate?

It varies by lender and market conditions, but typically:

**Conventional Loans:**
- 1 point = 0.25% rate reduction
- 2 points = 0.50% rate reduction

**Example:**
- 0 points: 6.75% rate
- 1 point ($3,000): 6.50% rate
- 2 points ($6,000): 6.25% rate

Not all points are created equal. Sometimes 1 point only buys 0.125% rate reduction. Sometimes it buys 0.375%. Ask your lender for specific pricing.

## How to Calculate Break-Even on Points

Break-even is how long it takes for monthly payment savings to recoup the upfront cost.

**Formula:**
Cost of points ÷ monthly payment savings = months to break even

**Example:**
$300,000 loan, comparing 0 points vs. 1 point

**Option A: 0 Points**
- Rate: 6.75%
- Monthly P&I: $1,946
- Upfront cost: $0

**Option B: 1 Point**
- Rate: 6.50%
- Monthly P&I: $1,896
- Upfront cost: $3,000

**Break-Even Calculation:**
- Monthly savings: $50
- Upfront cost: $3,000
- Break-even: $3,000 ÷ $50 = **60 months (5 years)**

If you keep the loan 5+ years, buying the point saves money. Less than 5 years? You lose money.

## When Buying Points Makes Sense

**You're Staying Long-Term**
If you plan to keep the home and loan 10+ years, buying points can save tens of thousands in interest.

**Break-Even is Reasonable**
If break-even is 3–5 years and you're confident you'll stay longer, go for it.

**You Have Cash to Spare**
If you're sitting on extra cash after down payment and reserves, using it to buy down the rate can be smarter than leaving it in a low-interest savings account.

**Rates Are High**
When rates are 7%+, buying them down to 6.50% makes more sense than when rates are already at 4%.

**Monthly Payment Matters for Qualification**
If you're borderline on DTI, buying down the rate to lower your payment might be the difference between approval and denial.

## When Buying Points Doesn't Make Sense

**You're Selling or Refinancing Soon**
Average homeowner moves every 7–10 years. Average mortgage is refinanced every 4–5 years. If break-even is 6 years, odds are you won't recoup the cost.

**Break-Even Is Too Long**
If it takes 10 years to break even, you're gambling on staying in the home a decade. Too risky for most borrowers.

**You Need Cash for Other Costs**
If paying points drains your reserves or forces you to skip home repairs, furniture, or emergency fund, don't do it.

**You Can Invest the Cash Better**
If you can earn 6–8% annually in investments, keeping your cash and taking the higher mortgage rate might make more financial sense.

**You're Doing Cash-Out Refinance**
Paying points to lower your rate on a cash-out refinance is usually backwards—you're pulling cash out while simultaneously paying cash upfront. Doesn't add up.

## Discount Points vs. Origination Points

Not all points are the same. There are two types:

**Discount Points:**
Voluntary fee to buy down your rate. Tax-deductible in the year paid (purchase loans) or amortized over loan life (refinances).

**Origination Points:**
Lender fee to process the loan (also called "origination fee"). NOT tax-deductible.

Always clarify which you're paying. "1 point origination" is a fee. "1 discount point" is buying down your rate.

## How Points Affect APR

Remember, APR includes fees. Paying points increases your APR even though it lowers your interest rate.

**Example:**
- Loan: $300,000
- Option A: 6.75% rate, 0 points, APR 6.82%
- Option B: 6.50% rate, 1 point ($3,000), APR 6.71%

Option B has a lower rate but higher upfront cost, so the APR is only slightly lower. Use APR to compare, but run break-even math based on your timeline.

## Negative Points (Lender Credits)

You can also go the opposite direction—accept a higher rate in exchange for lender credits that cover closing costs.

**Example:**
- Option A: 6.50% rate, you pay $4,000 closing costs
- Option B: 6.875% rate, lender gives you $4,000 credit (zero closing costs)

**When This Makes Sense:**
- You're low on cash and need help with closing costs
- You plan to refinance in 2–3 years (higher rate doesn't matter long-term)
- You're selling soon and want to minimize upfront costs

**When It Doesn't:**
- You're keeping the loan 10+ years (higher rate costs more over time)
- You have the cash to cover closing costs

Lender credits are the reverse of discount points—pay more monthly to save upfront.

## How to Negotiate Points with Florida Lenders

Points are negotiable. Here's how to get better pricing:

**Ask for Rate Sheets**
Request the full pricing menu showing rate vs. points. Some lenders won't volunteer this—force the transparency.

**Compare Multiple Lenders**
One lender might charge 1 point for 0.25% reduction. Another might give 0.375% for the same point. Shop it.

**Negotiate Origination Fees**
Don't confuse origination fees with discount points. Origination fees should be 0.5–1% max. Push back on higher fees.

**Bundle Costs**
Sometimes lenders will lower points if you commit to quick closing or waive inspection contingency (purchase loans). Be careful—don't compromise protections just for rate.

## Tax Deductibility of Discount Points

Discount points may be tax-deductible, but rules vary:

**Purchase Loans:**
Typically deductible in the year paid if:
- You itemize deductions
- Points are calculated as % of loan amount
- Paying points is standard in your market
- You paid them from funds separate from the loan

**Refinance Loans:**
Typically deductible over the life of the loan (amortized). If you paid $3,000 in points on a 30-year refinance, you deduct $100/year for 30 years.

Consult a tax professional. Tax law changes, and your situation might differ.

## How to Decide: Points or No Points?

Run the math using this decision tree:

**Step 1: Calculate Break-Even**
Points cost ÷ monthly savings = months to break even

**Step 2: Estimate Loan Timeline**
How long do you realistically expect to keep this loan? (Be honest—most people refinance or move within 7 years)

**Step 3: Compare Timeline to Break-Even**
- If timeline > break-even: Buying points saves money
- If timeline < break-even: Skip points, take higher rate

**Step 4: Check Your Cash Position**
Do you have excess cash after down payment, closing costs, and 3–6 months reserves? If not, don't buy points.

**Step 5: Consider Opportunity Cost**
Could you invest the cash and earn better returns elsewhere? If yes, skip points.

Most first-time buyers should skip points. Most long-term homeowners should consider them.

## Real-World Example: Florida Purchase Loan

**Borrower:** Buying a $400,000 home, 20% down ($80,000), $320,000 loan

**Option A: No Points**
- Rate: 6.875%
- Monthly P&I: $2,106
- Upfront cost: $0

**Option B: 1 Point**
- Rate: 6.625%
- Monthly P&I: $2,050
- Upfront cost: $3,200

**Option C: 2 Points**
- Rate: 6.375%
- Monthly P&I: $1,995
- Upfront cost: $6,400

**Break-Even:**
- Option B: $3,200 ÷ $56 = 57 months (4.75 years)
- Option C: $6,400 ÷ $111 = 58 months (4.8 years)

**Decision:**
- Planning to stay 10+ years? Buy 2 points (saves $40,000 in interest over 30 years)
- Planning to stay 5–7 years? Buy 1 point (moderate savings)
- Planning to sell/refinance in 3 years? Buy 0 points (you won't break even)

## Ready to decide on discount points?

Calculate break-even, estimate your timeline, check your cash position, and request rate sheets from multiple Florida lenders. Points education first, then informed decisions based on your situation.
