You see "3.75% rates!" on a billboard. You check online and see "3.50% available now!" Then you apply and suddenly your rate is 4.25%. What happened? Here's how Florida mortgage rates actually work—and why advertised rates rarely apply to your situation.

## The Three Layers of Mortgage Rate Pricing

Mortgage rates aren't pulled from thin air. They're built in layers:

**Layer 1: Base Rate (Market-Driven)**
The foundation comes from the 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market. When bond investors demand higher returns, mortgage rates rise. When they accept lower returns, rates drop.

Nobody controls this—not lenders, not the Federal Reserve directly. It's market-driven based on economic conditions, inflation expectations, and global investor demand.

**Layer 2: Lender Margin (Business Costs)**
Lenders add a margin to cover operating costs—underwriters, processors, compliance staff, technology, marketing. This margin varies by lender.

Big banks might add 1.5–2% margin. Credit unions might add 1–1.5%. Direct lenders might be somewhere in between. This is why the same borrower gets different rate quotes from different lenders on the same day.

**Layer 3: Risk-Based Pricing (Your Specific Factors)**
Here's where your individual scenario affects the rate. Lenders adjust pricing based on:
- Credit score (every 20-point tier matters)
- Loan-to-value ratio (95% LTV costs more than 80%)
- Debt-to-income ratio (45% DTI costs more than 36%)
- Property type (condo costs more than single-family)
- Occupancy (investment property costs more than primary residence)
- Loan purpose (cash-out refinance costs more than purchase)
- Loan amount (jumbo loans priced differently than conforming)

A borrower with 780 credit, 20% down, 30% DTI on a primary residence purchase gets the best pricing. A borrower with 680 credit, 5% down, 48% DTI on a condo gets worst pricing. Same market, same lender, different rates.

## Why Advertised Rates Don't Apply to You

That 3.50% billboard rate? It's typically for:
- 760+ credit score
- 20–25% down payment
- Primary residence
- Single-family home
- Purchase (not refinance)
- Conforming loan amount
- 30% or lower DTI
- Buying 2–3 points upfront

If even one of those doesn't match your scenario, your rate will be higher. Most borrowers don't qualify for advertised rates.

## What the Federal Reserve Actually Controls

Everyone blames "the Fed" when rates rise. But the Federal Reserve doesn't set mortgage rates directly.

**What the Fed Controls:**
- Federal Funds Rate (overnight bank-to-bank lending rate)
- MBS purchase programs (quantitative easing/tightening)

**What the Fed Doesn't Control:**
- Your mortgage rate
- How lenders price individual loans
- Bond market investor behavior

When the Fed raises the Federal Funds Rate, it *influences* mortgage rates by affecting economic conditions and inflation expectations. But mortgage rates can rise when the Fed cuts rates, and fall when the Fed raises rates—because bond markets react to expectations, not just Fed actions.

## How Your Credit Score Affects Your Florida Rate

Lenders price rates in tiers. Here's how it typically works (numbers are illustrative, not guaranteed):

**Conventional Loans:**
- 760+: Best pricing (base rate)
- 740–759: +0.125–0.25% to rate
- 720–739: +0.25–0.375% to rate
- 700–719: +0.375–0.50% to rate
- 680–699: +0.50–0.75% to rate
- 660–679: +0.75–1.00% to rate
- 640–659: +1.00–1.50% to rate
- 620–639: +1.50–2.00% to rate

**Example:** If the base rate is 6.50%, a 760 credit score gets 6.50%. A 680 credit score gets 7.00–7.25%. Same borrower profile, half-point difference just from credit.

Small credit improvements matter. Boosting from 715 to 725 can save you 0.125–0.25% on rate. Over 30 years on a $300,000 loan, that's $10,000–$20,000 in interest savings.

## How LTV (Loan-to-Value) Affects Pricing

Higher down payment = lower risk = better rate.

**Typical LTV Pricing (Purchase):**
- 75% LTV or lower (25%+ down): Best pricing
- 80% LTV (20% down): +0.125–0.25%
- 85% LTV (15% down): +0.25–0.50%
- 90% LTV (10% down): +0.50–0.75%
- 95% LTV (5% down): +0.75–1.25%
- 97% LTV (3% down): +1.00–1.50%

Putting 20% down instead of 5% can save 0.75–1.00% on your rate. That's $150–$200 monthly on a $300,000 loan—plus you avoid PMI.

## How Loan Purpose Affects Rates

Not all mortgages are priced the same:

**Purchase Loans:** Best pricing (lenders view new purchases as lower risk)

**Rate-and-Term Refinance:** +0.125–0.375% compared to purchase (lenders make less profit on refinances)

**Cash-Out Refinance:** +0.375–0.625% compared to purchase (higher risk because you're reducing equity)

If you're refinancing to take cash out, expect a higher rate than someone buying with the same credit and LTV.

## How to Get Your Actual Florida Rate Quote

Stop chasing advertised rates. Here's how to get real pricing:

**Step 1: Know Your Numbers**
- Check your middle credit score (all three bureaus)
- Calculate your LTV (loan amount ÷ home value)
- Know your DTI (monthly debts ÷ gross monthly income)
- Identify property type and occupancy

**Step 2: Request Loan Estimates from 3 Lenders**
Apply to 3 Florida lenders within 14 days. Credit bureaus count multiple mortgage inquiries as one hit.

**Step 3: Compare APR, Not Just Rate**
APR includes rate plus fees. A 6.50% rate with $5,000 in fees might have a higher APR than a 6.625% rate with $2,000 in fees.

**Step 4: Verify All Assumptions**
Check the Loan Estimate for credit score, LTV, loan amount, property type. If lenders used 760 credit and you're actually 720, your rate will be higher at closing.

## Why Rates Change Between Quote and Closing

You get a rate quote on Monday. You lock on Wednesday. Closing is in 30 days. Why did the rate change?

**Rate Locks Expire**
Most locks last 30–45 days. If your closing delays, you may need to extend (costs $500–$1,000) or accept current market rates.

**You Didn't Actually Lock**
Some borrowers get a "rate quote" but never formally locked. Market moves and their rate floats. Always confirm lock status in writing.

**Your Scenario Changed**
Appraisal came in lower = higher LTV = higher rate. Credit score dropped = higher rate. Added debt before closing = higher DTI = higher rate.

**Lender Found Issues**
Underwriter discovered income is lower than stated, employment gap, or credit issue = higher rate or denial.

Lock your rate in writing when you're ready. Verify assumptions match reality. Don't make major financial changes before closing.
