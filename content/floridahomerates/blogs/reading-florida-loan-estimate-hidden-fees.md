You applied to three Florida lenders. Now you have three Loan Estimates. They all look different, use different terminology, and you're not sure which is actually cheaper. Here's how to read a Loan Estimate and compare lenders accurately.

## What Is a Loan Estimate?

The Loan Estimate is a standardized 3-page form lenders must provide within 3 business days of your mortgage application. It replaced the old Good Faith Estimate (GFE) in 2015.

**What It Shows:**
- Your interest rate and monthly payment
- Estimated closing costs broken down by category
- Total cash needed to close
- APR (true cost including fees)

**Why It Matters:**
Every lender uses the same format, making apples-to-apples comparisons possible—if you know what to look for.

## Page 1: Loan Terms and Projected Payments

**Top Section: Loan Information**
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Monthly principal & interest
- Does the rate/payment change? (fixed vs. ARM)
- Prepayment penalty? (rare, but check)
- Balloon payment? (rare on standard mortgages)

**Red Flags:**
- Rate or payment can change (unless you wanted an ARM)
- Prepayment penalty exists (walk away—this limits your ability to refinance)
- Balloon payment (you owe full balance before loan end)

**Middle Section: Projected Payments**
Shows your estimated monthly payment including principal, interest, mortgage insurance (if applicable), and estimated taxes/insurance.

**What to Check:**
- Is PMI included? (Should be if you put less than 20% down)
- Are taxes/insurance estimates realistic? (Check your property tax records and homeowners insurance quotes)
- When does PMI drop off? (Conventional loans: when you hit 78–80% LTV)

**Bottom Section: Costs at Closing**
- Estimated closing costs (from page 2)
- Estimated cash to close (down payment + closing costs - credits)

**What to Check:**
- Does "Cash to Close" match what you budgeted?
- Are seller credits or lender credits included?

## Page 2: Closing Cost Details (THIS IS WHERE YOU COMPARE LENDERS)

Page 2 breaks down every fee into sections. This is where lenders compete—and where they hide costs.

### Section A: Origination Charges (THE MOST IMPORTANT)

This is what the lender charges to process your loan. **This is where you compare lenders.**

**Common Line Items:**
- **Origination fee / points:** What lender charges (0.5–2% of loan amount)
- **Application fee:** $0–$500 (often waived)
- **Underwriting fee:** $400–$900
- **Processing fee:** $300–$700

**How to Compare:**
Add up Section A across all three Loan Estimates. Lowest total Section A = best lender pricing.

**Example:**
- Lender A Section A: $5,200
- Lender B Section A: $3,800
- Lender C Section A: $4,500

Lender B is $1,400 cheaper than Lender A, even if Lender A's rate is slightly lower.

**Red Flags:**
- "Points" without rate reduction (you're paying for nothing)
- Multiple fees that sound the same (application + processing + admin = triple-charging)
- Fees over 2% of loan amount (way too high)

### Section B: Services You Cannot Shop For

These are third-party services the lender requires and selects:

- **Appraisal fee:** $400–$700 in Florida
- **Credit report:** $30–$75
- **Flood certification:** $15–$25
- **Tax service fee:** $50–$100

**What to Check:**
Fees should be similar across lenders (market rate for services). Big differences mean one lender is padding costs.

**Can't Negotiate:**
These are set by third parties. You can question high fees, but you can't eliminate them.

### Section C: Services You Can Shop For

These are third-party services where you can choose your own provider:

- **Title search and insurance:** $1,000–$2,500 in Florida
- **Survey:** $300–$500 (if required)
- **Attorney fees:** $500–$1,500 (if applicable)

**How to Save:**
Shop title companies yourself. Lender's recommendation might not be cheapest.

### Sections D, E, F: Taxes, Prepaids, Other Costs

**Section E: Taxes and Government Fees**
- Recording fees: $50–$200
- Transfer taxes: Varies by county (seller usually pays in Florida)

**Section F: Prepaids**
- Homeowners insurance: First year paid upfront ($1,200–$3,000+ in Florida)
- Property taxes: 2–6 months into escrow
- Prepaid interest: From closing date to end of month

**Section G: Initial Escrow Payment**
- Additional property taxes (2–6 months)
- Additional homeowners insurance (2–6 months)

**What to Know:**
These aren't lender fees—they're real costs you'd pay regardless. But lenders can overestimate to make cash-to-close look higher.

Check:
- Are tax estimates accurate? (Look up your county tax rate)
- Is insurance estimate realistic? (Get your own quote)

### Section H: Other Costs

- HOA fees (if applicable)
- Home inspection (you pay separately, not at closing)
- Homeowners warranty (optional)

**What to Check:**
Is anything listed here that shouldn't be? Some lenders sneak in optional services you didn't agree to.

## Page 3: The Comparison Tools

**Top Left: Comparisons**
- In 5 years, you will have paid: $X in principal + $Y in interest + $Z in fees/costs
- APR: True cost including fees

**What to Use:**
Compare the "In 5 Years" number across lenders. Lowest = best deal.

**Why It Matters:**
Shows total cost assuming you keep the loan 5 years (average homeowner timeline). If Lender A has lower rate but higher fees, this number reveals it.

**Top Right: Other Considerations**
- Appraisal: Can you get a copy? (You paid for it—you should)
- Homeowner's insurance: Can shop around (always do this)
- Late payment: What's the penalty?
- Refinance: Can you refinance without penalty? (Should be yes)
- Servicing: Can lender sell your loan to another servicer? (Almost always yes)

**Bottom: Confirmation**
This is where you confirm you received the Loan Estimate and understand it.

## How to Compare 3 Florida Loan Estimates Side-by-Side

Create a simple comparison chart:

| Item | Lender A | Lender B | Lender C |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Interest Rate | 6.50% | 6.625% | 6.50% |
| APR (Page 3) | 6.78% | 6.69% | 6.85% |
| Section A (Origination) | $5,200 | $3,800 | $6,000 |
| Section B (Required Services) | $850 | $820 | $900 |
| Section C (Title/Settlement) | $1,800 | $1,600 | $1,900 |
| Total Closing Costs | $7,850 | $6,220 | $8,800 |
| Cash to Close | $72,850 | $71,220 | $73,800 |
| In 5 Years Total Cost | $142,000 | $141,200 | $144,500 |

**Winner: Lender B**
- Slightly higher rate (6.625% vs. 6.50%)
- But lowest APR (6.69%)
- Lowest origination fees ($3,800)
- Lowest total closing costs ($6,220)
- Lowest 5-year total cost ($141,200)

Lender A's lower rate doesn't make up for the extra $1,400 in fees.

## Common Junk Fees to Spot and Remove

These fees are nonsense. Negotiate them away or walk:

**"Document Preparation Fee" ($300–$800):**
Lender charges you to prepare documents they're legally required to prepare. Ridiculous.

**"Email Fee" or "Electronic Document Fee" ($50–$150):**
Charging you to send PDFs. Walk away.

**"Courier Fee" ($75–$200):**
Lender's cost to send documents overnight. Not your problem.

**"Administrative Fee" ($500–$1,000):**
Vague fee covering... nothing specific. Push back hard.

**"Rate Lock Fee" ($200–$500):**
Some lenders charge to lock your rate. Others include it. Negotiate.

If lender won't remove junk fees, switch lenders.

## What Changes Are Allowed Between Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure?

The Loan Estimate is an estimate—some costs will change by closing. But federal law limits what can change:

**Zero Tolerance (Can't Increase):**
- Lender fees (Section A)
- Title services if lender chose provider

**10% Tolerance (Can Increase Up to 10%):**
- Recording fees
- Title services if you chose provider
- Required third-party services (appraisal, credit report)

**No Limit (Can Change):**
- Prepaids (taxes, insurance, interest)
- Daily rate changes

**Red Flag:**
If Section A costs increase between Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure, lender broke the rules. Demand they honor the original estimate or file a CFPB complaint.

## Questions to Ask Your Lender About the Loan Estimate

**1. "Why is your Section A higher/lower than the other lenders I'm comparing?"**
Forces them to justify their pricing.

**2. "Can you remove [junk fee name] from Section A?"**
See what's negotiable.

**3. "Is this the rate I'll get at closing, assuming nothing changes on my end?"**
Locks them into the quote.

**4. "What would cause my costs to increase between now and closing?"**
Understand the risks.

**5. "Can I shop for my own title company to lower Section C costs?"**
Take control of what you can.

## How Soon After Receiving the Loan Estimate Should You Decide?

**Don't Rush:**
You have time to compare. Rates can be locked days or weeks after receiving Loan Estimates.

**Don't Wait Forever:**
Rates change daily. If you wait 3 weeks, your Loan Estimate is outdated.

**Ideal Timeline:**
- Receive Loan Estimates from 3 lenders within same week
- Compare over 2–3 days
- Make decision and lock rate within 1 week of receiving estimates

One week is enough to compare carefully without overthinking.

## Red Flags That Mean Walk Away

**Loan Estimate Arrives Late:**
Federal law requires it within 3 business days of application. Late delivery = disorganized lender.

**Fees Are Vague:**
"Miscellaneous fees: $1,200" with no breakdown. Demand itemization.

**Lender Won't Explain Fees:**
If you ask about a fee and get evasive answers, walk.

**Numbers Don't Match Verbal Quote:**
You were quoted 6.50% with $4,000 fees. Loan Estimate shows 6.75% with $6,500 fees. Bait-and-switch.

**Section A Over 2% of Loan Amount:**
$300,000 loan, $8,000 in Section A fees? Too expensive.

## Ready to compare Florida Loan Estimates like a pro?

Request Loan Estimates from 3 lenders within 14 days, compare Section A fees and APR, spot junk fees, and choose the lender with the lowest total cost. Loan Estimate education first, then confident comparisons.
