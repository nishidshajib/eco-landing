You get a rate quote. Should you lock immediately or wait? If you lock and rates drop, are you stuck? If you don't lock and rates spike, did you blow it? Here's how rate locks actually work in Florida—and how to time them without gambling.

## What a Rate Lock Actually Is

A rate lock is a written agreement that the lender will honor a specific interest rate for a set period (usually 30–60 days) regardless of market changes.

**If rates rise after you lock:** You're protected. Your rate stays the same.

**If rates fall after you lock:** You're typically stuck with the higher locked rate (unless you have a float-down option).

Rate locks protect you from market volatility during the 30–45 days between application and closing. But they're not free—longer locks cost more.

## How Long Do Florida Rate Locks Last?

Standard lock periods in Florida:

**30-Day Lock:** Most common for purchase loans with quick closings
**45-Day Lock:** Standard for most transactions
**60-Day Lock:** Common for refinances or purchases with longer timelines
**90-Day Lock:** New construction or complex transactions

Longer locks cost more. Here's typical pricing (added to your rate or paid as a fee):

- 30-day lock: Base pricing (no extra cost)
- 45-day lock: +0.125% to rate or ~$500 fee
- 60-day lock: +0.25% to rate or ~$1,000 fee
- 90-day lock: +0.50% to rate or ~$2,000 fee

If your closing timeline is uncertain, budget for a longer lock or potential extension fees.

## When to Lock Your Rate (and When to Wait)

**Lock Immediately If:**
- You're happy with the rate and can close within the lock period
- Rates are trending upward
- Your closing date is firm and less than 45 days out
- You can't handle the stress of rates potentially rising

**Float (Don't Lock) If:**
- Rates are trending downward
- Your closing is 60+ days out (you'd pay for a long lock)
- You have documentation issues that might delay closing
- You're willing to gamble on market movement

Most borrowers should lock when they're satisfied with the rate and confident they'll close within the lock period. Floating is gambling—sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

## What Happens If Your Lock Expires Before Closing

Your lock expires in 45 days. Closing gets delayed to day 50. Now what?

**Option 1: Pay for a Lock Extension**
Most lenders charge $500–$1,500 for 15–30 day extensions. Sometimes free if the delay is lender-caused (slow appraisal, underwriting backup).

**Option 2: Re-Lock at Current Market Rate**
If rates dropped since your original lock, re-locking might be better than extending. If rates rose, you're paying more.

**Option 3: Walk Away**
If rates spiked significantly and you can't afford the new payment, you can cancel (but you lose your appraisal fee and any other upfront costs).

**How to Avoid This:**
- Add 5–7 days buffer to your estimated closing date when choosing lock period
- Stay on top of documentation requests (don't cause delays)
- Communicate with your lender about timeline issues early

## Float-Down Options: Are They Worth It?

Some lenders offer "float-down" provisions—if rates drop after you lock, you can re-lock at the lower rate.

**Typical Float-Down Terms:**
- Rates must drop 0.25–0.50% to qualify (small drops don't count)
- Available only once during the lock period
- May require a fee ($500–$1,000)
- Must be requested 5–7 days before closing

**When Float-Down Makes Sense:**
- You're locking 60+ days out and expect rate volatility
- You're willing to pay the extra fee for downside protection

**When It Doesn't:**
- You're locking 30 days out (less time for rates to move)
- The fee is high relative to potential savings
- Rates are already at historical lows

Most borrowers don't need float-down. If you're locking at a rate you're comfortable with, accept it and move forward.

## How to Lock Your Rate the Right Way

Don't rely on verbal agreements. Here's how to lock properly:

**Step 1: Request Written Lock Confirmation**
Email or formal lock agreement showing:
- Exact interest rate
- Lock expiration date
- Loan amount, loan type, property address
- Any points or fees paid
- Float-down provisions (if applicable)

**Step 2: Verify All Assumptions**
Check that the lock reflects:
- Your actual credit score (not an estimate)
- Correct LTV based on down payment or appraisal
- Right property type and occupancy
- Correct loan program

If lenders locked based on 760 credit and you're actually 720, your rate will change.

**Step 3: Confirm in Writing Within 24 Hours**
Reply to the lock confirmation email: "Confirmed. Rate locked at 6.50% for 45 days, expiring [date]."

Creates a paper trail if disputes arise.

## What Moves Mortgage Rates Day-to-Day

Rates change constantly. Understanding why helps you time locks better.

**What Causes Rate Increases:**
- Strong jobs reports (economy heating up)
- High inflation data (erodes bond value)
- Federal Reserve hawkish statements (signals rate hikes)
- Stock market rallies (money flows out of bonds into stocks)

**What Causes Rate Decreases:**
- Weak economic data (recession fears)
- Low inflation reports
- Federal Reserve dovish statements (signals rate cuts)
- Stock market selloffs (money flows into bonds for safety)

You can't predict these perfectly. Lock when you're satisfied, not when you're trying to time the absolute bottom.

## Should You Lock Before Finding a Home?

Some lenders offer "early rate locks" or "Lock and Shop" programs—lock a rate for 60–90 days before you find a property.

**Pros:**
- Protected if rates rise while house hunting
- Know your exact payment when making offers

**Cons:**
- Pay for long lock period (added fees or higher rate)
- Locked into that lender (can't shop competitors)
- Rate lock expires if you don't find a home in time

**When It Makes Sense:**
- You're actively shopping and expect to close within 60 days
- Rates are rising fast
- Competitive market where you need certainty on financing

**When It Doesn't:**
- You're just starting to look (might take 6 months)
- Rates are stable or falling
- You want flexibility to shop lenders after finding a home

Most buyers should wait until they have a ratified contract before locking.

## How Rate Locks Work for Florida Refinances

Refinance rate locks work differently than purchase:

**No Urgency:** You're not under contract with a closing deadline. You can float until rates hit your target (if you're willing to gamble).

**More Flexibility:** If rates spike after you lock, you can cancel the refinance (you're not buying a home you committed to). You lose the appraisal fee, but that's it.

**Longer Timelines:** Refinances often take 45–60 days. Budget for a 60-day lock or pay extension fees.

Many Florida homeowners float refinances until rates hit their break-even target. If rates don't cooperate, they cancel without penalty.

## Red Flags: Rate Lock Scams

Watch for these tactics:

**Verbal Lock (No Written Confirmation)**
Lender says you're locked. Rates rise. Lender claims you never locked. Always get written confirmation.

**Bait-and-Switch Lock**
Locked at 6.50%. Closing Disclosure shows 6.75%. Lender blames "changed circumstances" (credit score, appraisal, etc.). Verify nothing changed on your end.

**Fake Float-Down**
Lender advertises "free float-down!" Then rates drop 0.375% and they say "must drop 0.50% to qualify." Read the fine print.

**Expiration Pressure**
"Your lock expires Friday—close now or pay $1,500 extension!" Sometimes true, sometimes manufactured urgency. Verify lock date yourself.

**Hidden Extension Fees**
Lender causes delays (slow appraisal, underwriting backup) then charges YOU for extension. Push back—lender-caused delays should mean free extensions.

## 30-Day Rate Lock Strategy

If you want to maximize your odds of locking at the best rate:

**Day 1–7:** Watch rates, gather documents, get pre-approved
**Day 8–14:** Request Loan Estimates from 3 lenders (compare within 2-week credit inquiry window)
**Day 15–21:** Choose lender, finalize documentation
**Day 22–30:** Lock rate when satisfied and ready to proceed

Don't overthink it. Rates might drop 0.125% next week, or spike 0.25%. Lock when you're comfortable and execute.

## Ready to lock your Florida mortgage rate?

Understand lock periods, request written confirmation, verify all assumptions, and lock when you're satisfied with the rate and confident in your closing timeline. Rate education first, then confident execution.
