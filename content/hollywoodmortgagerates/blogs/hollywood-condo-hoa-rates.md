## Hollywood Condo HOA Fees and Mortgage Rates: What Actually Changes Your APR

Hollywood is a condo-heavy market, and condo loans are priced differently than single-family homes. **HOA health and building eligibility** can push APR higher even when your credit and income look perfect.

Here are the condo factors that actually move pricing:

### 1 HOA Reserve Strength
If the HOA keeps **too little in reserves**, lenders price the loan as higher risk. This can add 0.125%–0.25% to APR or trigger a lender overlay.

**What to ask:**
- What percent of dues go to reserves?
- Are there deferred maintenance items?

### 2 Owner-Occupancy Ratio
If too many units are investor-owned, lenders view the building as less stable.

**Typical rule of thumb:**
- 50%+ owner-occupied is safer
- Below 40% can trigger rate hits or loan denial

### 3 HOA Delinquencies and Litigation
High delinquency rates or active litigation can change pricing tiers or force manual review.

**Impact:**
- Delinquency > 15% often means higher pricing
- Litigation can block approval entirely with some lenders

### 4 Condo Insurance Coverage
Insufficient master policy coverage causes last-minute changes. If coverage is weak, some lenders require additional policies or pricing adjustments.

## How Hollywood Buyers Avoid Condo Pricing Surprises

1. **Ask about the building upfront.** Provide the condo name during pre-approval.
2. **Request a condo-aware lender.** Not every lender handles Hollywood condos well.
3. **Compare APR, not just rate.** Condo overlays show up in the APR.
4. **Leave time for HOA review.** HOA documents can add 1–2 weeks to escrow.

Hollywood condos can still close smoothly—but only if the lender understands the building and the HOA’s financials.
