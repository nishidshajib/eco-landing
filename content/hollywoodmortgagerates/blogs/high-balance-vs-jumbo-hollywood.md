## High-Balance vs. Jumbo in Hollywood: How to Know Which Tier You’re Really In

Hollywood buyers often land in the **high-balance conforming** zone. The problem: some lenders automatically quote jumbo pricing when they see a large loan amount—even if the property is eligible for high-balance conforming.

### Why the Tier Matters
- **High-balance conforming** often runs **0.25%–0.50% lower APR** than jumbo.
- Jumbo loans may require stricter reserves and lower DTI caps.
- Misclassification can cost thousands over the first 5–7 years.

### Quick Signals Your Loan Might Be High-Balance (Not Jumbo)
1. **Location in LA County** with high-balance limits
2. **Loan amount** just above standard conforming, but below the high-balance cap
3. **Strong credit tier** (740+) and standard occupancy (primary residence)

### How to Prevent Mispricing
- **Ask the lender to confirm the tier in writing.**
- **Compare at least two lenders**—one broker and one bank.
- **Review the Loan Estimate** for the pricing tier, not just the rate.

### Hollywood Tip
In Hollywood Hills and Sunset Strip, jumbo is common—but in many West Hollywood and Studio City deals, **high-balance conforming** still applies. Don’t assume jumbo pricing just because the home is expensive.

High-balance pricing is one of the easiest places to save in Hollywood—if you confirm the tier before you lock.
