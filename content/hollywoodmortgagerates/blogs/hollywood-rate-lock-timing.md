## Hollywood Rate Lock Timing: How to Match the Lock to Your Escrow

Hollywood escrows move fast—until they don’t. Condo document reviews, appraisal delays, or title issues can extend timelines past 30 days, which makes a short lock risky.

### A Simple Lock Framework for Hollywood Buyers
**30-day lock**
- Works when the file is clean and the condo docs are already in-hand
- Higher risk of extension fees

**45-day lock**
- The safest default for Hollywood condos and hillside homes
- Helps avoid paying extension fees if the HOA review drags on

**60-day lock**
- Best for complex condos, new construction, or when the seller is still clearing items

### What Extensions Can Cost
Extension fees vary by lender, but they can add **0.125%–0.25%** to pricing if the lock expires. On a Hollywood loan, that’s real money.

### How to Decide
1. **Ask the lender about recent closing timelines** in your neighborhood.
2. **Confirm condo review turnaround** if you’re buying a condo or townhome.
3. **Pick the lock that fits the slowest part** of your transaction, not the fastest.

Locking for the right window keeps your pricing intact and prevents last-minute surprises. In Hollywood, that often means starting with a 45-day lock and adjusting if your file is exceptionally clean.
