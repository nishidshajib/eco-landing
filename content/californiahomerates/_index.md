California mortgage rates vary 0.25%–0.50% between lenders for the same borrower on the same day. With median home prices exceeding $800K statewide ($1.5M+ in Bay Area), even 0.125% = $70–150/month or $5,000–9,000 over five years.

California's **high-balance conforming limit** ($1,149,825 in most counties) saves 0.50%–0.75% vs. jumbo on $800K–1.15M loans. Bay Area and LA brokers access 20–50 wholesale lenders; Inland Empire banks offer one rate sheet. Shopping brokers vs. banks saves 0.25%–0.375% = $175–260/month on typical $900K loans.

Rate shopping is the highest-ROI activity California buyers can perform—30 minutes comparing Loan Estimates saves $15,000–25,000 over the loan life. **Compare lenders at [Browse Lenders®](https://www.browselenders.com)**—filter by region, loan type, and specialty.
