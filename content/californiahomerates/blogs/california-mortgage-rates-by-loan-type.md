## Why California Mortgage Rates Vary by Loan Type

California borrowers face **six distinct mortgage rate tiers** based on loan type, loan amount, and government guarantee structure:

1. **USDA** (0% down, rural areas) — **Lowest rates** (6.00%–6.375% as of January 2026)
2. **VA** (0% down, veterans) — **Second-lowest rates** (6.125%–6.50%)
3. **FHA** (3.5% down, government-insured) — **Slightly below conventional** (6.25%–6.625%)
4. **Conventional conforming** (up to $806,500) — **Baseline market rates** (6.375%–6.75%)
5. **High-balance conforming** ($806,500–$1,149,825 in California) — **0.125%–0.25% above standard conforming** (6.50%–7.00%)
6. **Jumbo** ($1,149,825+ in California) — **0.50%–0.75% above conforming** (6.75%–7.50%)

**Why rates differ**: Government-backed loans (FHA, VA, USDA) have **lower default risk** for lenders (government insures/guarantees the loan) → lenders accept lower interest rates. Jumbo loans have **higher default risk** (no government backing, larger loan amounts, wealthier but more volatile borrower pool) → lenders charge premium rates.

**California-specific twist**: Most California counties have **$1,149,825 high-balance conforming limits** (vs. $806,500 standard limit nationwide). This creates a **unique pricing tier** for $800K–1.15M loans—priced between standard conforming and jumbo. Understanding this tier saves California borrowers 0.50%–0.75% vs. mistakenly shopping jumbo rates.

## 1. Conventional Conforming Loans (Up to $806,500)

### **What Is Conventional Conforming?**

**Conforming loans** meet Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac guidelines:
- Loan amount ≤ **$806,500** (2026 standard limit, nationwide)
- Down payment: 3%–20%+
- Credit score: 620+ (640+ recommended for best pricing)
- Debt-to-income (DTI): ≤50% (lenders prefer <43%)

Fannie/Freddie **buy these loans from lenders** → lenders can offer lower rates (they're not holding risk long-term, they sell to Fannie/Freddie immediately after closing).

### **Current California Conforming Rates (January 2026)**

**Rate range**: **6.375%–6.75%** (740+ credit, 20% down, primary residence)

**Rate by credit tier** ($700K loan, 20% down, Los Angeles):
- **780+ credit**: 6.375%–6.50%
- **760–779 credit**: 6.50%–6.625%
- **740–759 credit**: 6.625%–6.75%
- **720–739 credit**: 6.75%–6.875%
- **700–719 credit**: 6.875%–7.00%
- **680–699 credit**: 7.00%–7.25%
- **660–679 credit**: 7.25%–7.50%
- **640–659 credit**: 7.50%–7.875%
- **620–639 credit**: 7.875%–8.25%

**Down payment impact**:
- **20%+ down**: Baseline rate (6.375%–6.75%)
- **15% down**: +0.125% (PMI required, slightly higher risk)
- **10% down**: +0.25% (higher PMI, higher risk)
- **5% down**: +0.375%–0.50% (max PMI, max risk)
- **3% down**: +0.50%–0.625% (first-time buyer programs, high PMI)

**Property type impact**:
- **Primary residence**: Baseline rate
- **Second home**: +0.375%–0.50%
- **Investment property**: +0.625%–0.875%

### **When to Use Conventional Conforming in California**

✅ **Best for**:
- Purchase price ≤ **$920K** (with 20% down = $736K loan, under $806,500 limit)
- W2 income, 740+ credit, 5%–20% down
- Want lowest rates (conforming beats high-balance and jumbo)

❌ **Doesn't work if**:
- Purchase price > **$920K** (with 20% down, loan exceeds $806,500 → need high-balance conforming)
- Loan amount > $806,500 (even with 30% down on $1.2M home, $840K loan exceeds limit)

**Example**:
- Purchase price: $900K (Los Angeles)
- Down payment: 10% ($90K)
- Loan amount: $810K → **Exceeds $806,500 standard conforming limit**
- **Must use high-balance conforming** (California limit $1,149,825)
- Rate: 6.50%–6.875% (high-balance pricing, not standard conforming 6.375%–6.75%)

**California reality**: Most California buyers (median price $800K+) exceed standard conforming limit and use **high-balance conforming** instead.

---

## 2. High-Balance Conforming Loans ($806,500–$1,149,825 in California)

### **What Is High-Balance Conforming?**

**High-balance conforming** = Fannie/Freddie loans **above $806,500** but **below county-specific high-cost limit** ($1,149,825 in most California counties).

**California counties with $1,149,825 limit** (2026):
- Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino
- San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin
- Ventura, Sacramento, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Napa, Placer

**How high-balance works**: Fannie/Freddie still buy these loans, but charge lenders **higher guarantee fees** (because larger loans = higher risk). Lenders pass cost to borrowers via **0.125%–0.25% rate premium**.

### **Current California High-Balance Rates (January 2026)**

**Rate range**: **6.50%–7.00%** (740+ credit, 20% down, primary residence)

**High-balance premium**: **+0.125% to +0.25%** vs. standard conforming

**Example**:
- Standard conforming ($700K loan): **6.50%**
- High-balance conforming ($900K loan): **6.625%–6.75%** (0.125%–0.25% higher)

**Why the premium exists**: Fannie/Freddie charge lenders **0.25% higher guarantee fee** on high-balance loans. Lenders pass this to borrowers. But it's **still far cheaper than jumbo** (which prices 0.50%–0.75% above conforming).

### **High-Balance vs. Jumbo Savings**

**Scenario**: $1.1M loan (Los Angeles, 20% down on $1.375M purchase)

**High-balance conforming** (loan under $1,149,825 limit):
- Rate: **6.75%**
- Monthly payment: **$7,135**
- Qualifies under Fannie/Freddie guidelines (3%–5% down options, easier approval)

**Jumbo** (if lender mistakenly prices as jumbo, or borrower doesn't know high-balance exists):
- Rate: **7.25%** (0.50% higher)
- Monthly payment: **$7,507**
- **Extra cost**: $372/month, $22,320 over 5 years

**Knowing California high-balance limits saves $20K+** on loans between $806,500–$1,149,825.

### **When to Use High-Balance Conforming in California**

✅ **Best for**:
- Purchase price **$920K–$1.43M** (with 20% down, loan fits $806,500–1,149,825 range)
- W2 income, 680+ credit, 5%–20% down
- Want conforming guidelines (easier approval than jumbo) with slightly higher rate

❌ **Doesn't work if**:
- Loan amount > **$1,149,825** (must use jumbo)
- Property in **low-cost California county** (e.g., Imperial County limit is $766,550, not $1,149,825)

**Example**:
- Purchase price: $1.3M (San Francisco)
- Down payment: 15% ($195K)
- Loan amount: $1,105,000 → **Under $1,149,825 high-balance limit**
- Rate: **6.75%** (high-balance conforming)
- If mistakenly priced as jumbo: **7.25%** (costs $369/month more)

**Loan officer competence test**: If you're shopping $900K–1.1M loans in California and lender quotes jumbo rates (7%–7.5%), **they don't understand California high-balance limits—walk away**.

---

## 3. FHA Loans (Up to $806,500 or $1,149,825 High-Balance)

### **What Is FHA?**

**FHA** (Federal Housing Administration) loans are **government-insured** (if borrower defaults, FHA reimburses lender). This lowers lender risk → FHA rates are typically **0.125%–0.25% below conventional**.

**FHA loan limits** (2026):
- **Standard**: $498,257 (floor limit, applies to low-cost areas)
- **High-cost California**: Up to **$1,149,825** (same as conforming high-balance, most CA counties)

**Key FHA features**:
- **3.5% down** (minimum)
- **580 credit** (minimum, but most lenders require 620+)
- **Upfront MIP**: 1.75% of loan amount (financed into loan)
- **Monthly MIP**: 0.55%–0.85% of loan amount/year (for life of loan if <10% down)

**FHA trade-off**: Lower rate + low down payment, but **permanent mortgage insurance** (MIP never cancels unless you put 10%+ down, then cancels after 11 years). Conventional PMI cancels at 78% LTV (after ~5–8 years of payments + appreciation).

### **Current California FHA Rates (January 2026)**

**Rate range**: **6.25%–6.625%** (640+ credit, 3.5% down)

**FHA vs. conventional rate comparison** ($600K loan, 5% down, 680 credit, Los Angeles):

**FHA**:
- Rate: **6.375%**
- Upfront MIP: 1.75% × $600K = $10,500 (financed → actual loan $610,500)
- Monthly MIP: 0.85% × $600K ÷ 12 = **$425/month** (for life of loan)
- Total monthly payment: $3,854 (P&I) + $425 (MIP) = **$4,279**

**Conventional**:
- Rate: **6.75%** (0.375% higher than FHA, due to 5% down + 680 credit)
- PMI: ~0.65% × $600K ÷ 12 = **$325/month** (cancels after 5–8 years)
- Total monthly payment: $3,890 (P&I) + $325 (PMI) = **$4,215**

**FHA loses** in this scenario—higher monthly cost despite lower rate (due to lifetime MIP). But FHA wins if credit is <680 (conventional rates spike, FHA stays stable).

### **When to Use FHA in California**

✅ **Best for**:
- Credit **580–680** (FHA is more forgiving than conventional)
- **3.5% down** (can't afford 5%+ for conventional)
- Purchase price ≤ **$1M** (FHA works, but jumbo FHA rates aren't competitive above $1M)
- **Short-term ownership** (<5 years) then sell or refi (MIP is tolerable if you exit quickly)

❌ **Avoid FHA if**:
- Credit **720+** (conventional rates beat FHA + you avoid lifetime MIP)
- You can put **10%+ down** (conventional PMI cancels faster, FHA MIP lasts 11 years)
- Planning to stay **10+ years** (MIP costs $50K–100K+ over life of loan)

**Example: FHA makes sense**
- First-time buyer, 620 credit, 3.5% down, $550K purchase (Inland Empire)
- FHA rate: **6.50%**, monthly payment $3,686 (includes MIP)
- Conventional rate (620 credit, 3% down): **7.50%**, monthly payment $3,885
- **FHA saves $199/month** despite lifetime MIP (because conventional rates are terrible at 620 credit)

**Example: FHA loses to conventional**
- Move-up buyer, 760 credit, 5% down, $850K purchase (San Diego)
- FHA rate: **6.375%**, monthly payment $5,486 (includes lifetime MIP)
- Conventional rate: **6.50%**, monthly payment $5,396 (PMI cancels after 7 years)
- **Conventional saves $90/month + eliminates MIP after 7 years** (total savings $50K+ over loan life)

## 4. VA Loans (Up to $1,149,825 in California, 0% Down)

### **What Is VA?**

**VA loans** (Department of Veterans Affairs) are **government-guaranteed** for veterans, active-duty military, and qualifying spouses. VA guarantees 25% of loan → lenders accept **lowest rates** (even lower than FHA) because government backs the loan.

**VA loan limits** (2026):
- **No limit** if veteran has **full entitlement** (never used VA loan before, or paid off previous VA loan)
- **County limits apply** if veteran has **remaining entitlement** (used VA loan before, still owns that property). California county limit: **$1,149,825** (most counties)

**Key VA features**:
- **0% down** (borrow 100% of purchase price, no PMI/MIP)
- **No monthly mortgage insurance** (VA doesn't charge PMI/MIP)
- **VA funding fee**: 2.3% (first-time use) or 3.6% (subsequent use), waived for disabled veterans
- **580+ credit** (VA guidelines), but most lenders require **620–640+** for best rates

### **Current California VA Rates (January 2026)**

**Rate range**: **6.125%–6.50%** (640+ credit, 0% down)

**VA vs. conventional comparison** ($800K loan, Los Angeles):

**VA (0% down)**:
- Rate: **6.25%**
- Down payment: **$0**
- VA funding fee: 2.3% × $800K = $18,400 (financed → actual loan $818,400)
- Monthly payment: **$5,037** (no PMI/MIP)

**Conventional (5% down)**:
- Rate: **6.625%**
- Down payment: **$40,000**
- PMI: ~0.60% × $800K ÷ 12 = **$400/month**
- Monthly payment: $5,120 (P&I) + $400 (PMI) = **$5,520**

**VA saves $483/month** despite financing funding fee (because no PMI + lower rate). Plus VA requires **$0 down** (conventional requires $40K).

### **When to Use VA in California**

✅ **Best for**:
- **Veterans, active duty, qualifying spouses** (obviously)
- **0% down** (no savings for down payment, or prefer to keep cash liquid)
- **Primary residence** (VA doesn't allow investment properties)
- **Any California county** (VA works up to $1.15M+ with full entitlement)

❌ **Doesn't work if**:
- Not a veteran/active duty
- **Investment property** (VA only for owner-occupied)
- **Disabled veteran** (0% funding fee) buying **above $1.15M** (VA limits apply if using remaining entitlement, but disabled vets should always use VA if possible—no funding fee = massive savings)

**San Diego military market advantage**: San Diego has **highest concentration of VA lenders** in California (due to military bases). VA rate competition is intense → San Diego VA rates often **0.125%–0.25% lower** than Bay Area/LA for same borrower.

**Example**:
- Veteran, 720 credit, $900K purchase (San Diego)
- VA rate: **6.125%** (San Diego lender specializing in military)
- Conventional rate (5% down): **6.625%**
- **VA saves 0.50% = $331/month** + $0 down + no PMI

---

## 5. USDA Loans (0% Down, Rural California)

### **What Is USDA?**

**USDA** (U.S. Department of Agriculture) loans are **0% down, government-guaranteed** loans for **rural and suburban areas**. Designed for low-to-moderate income buyers in non-urban zones.

**California USDA eligibility**:
- Property must be in **USDA-eligible area** (rural/suburban, NOT Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Orange County metros)
- **Income limits**: Household income <115% of area median (varies by county, typically $100K–130K max)
- **Credit**: 640+ recommended

**USDA-eligible California areas**:
- Central Valley (Fresno, Bakersfield, Modesto, Stockton suburbs)
- Northern California (Redding, Chico, Eureka)
- Inland Empire outskirts (Hemet, Temecula, Murrieta)
- Sierra foothills (Grass Valley, Placerville)

**Key USDA features**:
- **0% down** (100% financing, like VA)
- **Upfront guarantee fee**: 1% (financed into loan)
- **Annual fee**: 0.35% of loan balance (like MIP/PMI, but much cheaper)

### **Current California USDA Rates (January 2026)**

**Rate range**: **6.00%–6.375%** (640+ credit, 0% down)

**USDA is the lowest rate** for 0% down loans (beats VA by 0.125%, beats FHA by 0.25%–0.50%).

**USDA vs. conventional comparison** ($400K loan, Fresno County):

**USDA (0% down)**:
- Rate: **6.125%**
- Down payment: **$0**
- Upfront fee: 1% × $400K = $4,000 (financed → $404K loan)
- Annual fee: 0.35% × $400K ÷ 12 = **$117/month**
- Monthly payment: $2,453 (P&I) + $117 (annual fee) = **$2,570**

**Conventional (3% down)**:
- Rate: **6.75%**
- Down payment: **$12,000**
- PMI: ~0.70% × $388K ÷ 12 = **$226/month**
- Monthly payment: $2,517 (P&I) + $226 (PMI) = **$2,743**

**USDA saves $173/month** + requires $0 down vs. $12K.

### **When to Use USDA in California**

✅ **Best for**:
- **Rural/suburban California** (Central Valley, Northern CA, Inland Empire outskirts)
- **Low-to-moderate income** (household <$100K–130K, varies by county)
- **0% down** (no savings, want lowest rate)
- **Primary residence** (USDA doesn't allow investment properties)

❌ **Doesn't work if**:
- Property in **metro areas** (LA, SF, SD, OC, SJ—not USDA-eligible)
- **Income too high** (>$130K household in most areas)
- **Investment property** (USDA owner-occupied only)

**California USDA reality**: Most California buyers don't qualify (too high income, property in metro area). But for **Central Valley first-time buyers**, USDA is **gold standard** (0% down, 6.00%–6.375% rates, minimal annual fee).

---

## 6. Jumbo Loans ($1,149,825+ in California)

### **What Is Jumbo?**

**Jumbo loans** exceed Fannie/Freddie conforming limits ($1,149,825 in most California counties). **No government backing** → lenders hold risk → charge **0.50%–0.75% premium** over conforming.

**California jumbo market**: Massive (median price $800K+, Bay Area/LA/OC median $1.2M–1.8M). Jumbo lenders range from **national banks** (Wells, Chase, BofA) to **portfolio lenders** (local banks, credit unions) to **wholesale jumbo specialists** (brokers access UWM, Pennymac jumbo programs).

**Jumbo guidelines** (stricter than conforming):
- **Down payment**: 10%–20% min (most lenders require 15%–20%)
- **Credit**: 700+ (740+ for best rates)
- **Reserves**: 6–12 months PITI (liquid assets after closing)
- **DTI**: ≤43% (some lenders allow 45% with strong profile)

### **Current California Jumbo Rates (January 2026)**

**Rate range**: **6.75%–7.50%** (740+ credit, 20% down, primary residence)

**Jumbo premium**: **+0.50% to +0.75%** vs. high-balance conforming

**Example**:
- High-balance conforming ($1.1M loan): **6.75%**
- Jumbo ($1.5M loan): **7.25%–7.50%** (0.50%–0.75% higher)

**Jumbo rate by credit tier** ($1.5M loan, 20% down, San Francisco):
- **780+ credit**: 7.00%–7.25%
- **760–779 credit**: 7.25%–7.375%
- **740–759 credit**: 7.375%–7.50%
- **720–739 credit**: 7.50%–7.75%
- **700–719 credit**: 7.75%–8.00%
- **<700 credit**: 8.00%–8.50% (or denied)

**Down payment impact** (jumbo loans):
- **25%+ down**: Best pricing (7.00%–7.25%)
- **20% down**: Baseline (7.25%–7.50%)
- **15% down**: +0.25% (7.50%–7.75%)
- **10% down**: +0.50% (7.75%–8.00%), if lender allows

### **Jumbo Rate Shopping: Brokers vs. Banks**

**Jumbo rate spread** (highest to lowest lender, same borrower): **0.375%–0.75%**

**Example**: $2M loan, 25% down, 780 credit, Los Angeles

**Wells Fargo** (retail bank):
- Rate: **7.50%**, monthly payment: **$10,498**

**Chase Private Client** (relationship banking, 0.25% discount):
- Rate: **7.25%**, monthly payment: **$10,238**

**Mortgage broker (shops 40 lenders, finds Pennymac jumbo)**:
- Rate: **6.875%**, monthly payment: **$9,850**

**Broker saves $388/month** ($23,280 over 5 years) vs. Chase, **$648/month** ($38,880 over 5 years) vs. Wells.

**Jumbo rate shopping is mandatory** in California. Rate spreads are massive (0.375%–0.75%) because jumbo lenders have discretion (no Fannie/Freddie standard pricing).

### **When to Use Jumbo in California**

✅ **Best for**:
- Loan amount **>$1,149,825** (exceeds conforming limit)
- **Bay Area, LA, Orange County luxury homes** ($1.5M–5M+)
- **Strong credit** (740+), **20%+ down**, **high income**
- **Rate shopping brokers** (jumbo rate spreads are huge, brokers access 20+ jumbo lenders)

❌ **Avoid jumbo if**:
- Loan is **under $1,149,825** (use high-balance conforming, save 0.50%–0.75%)
- Credit **<720** (jumbo rates spike to 7.75%–8.50%, nearly 1% above conforming)
- You skip rate shopping (retail bank jumbo rates are 0.375%–0.75% above broker wholesale jumbo)

**Example: Portfolio jumbo (relationship banking)**
- Wells Fargo Private Bank client, $10M in investments
- $3M jumbo loan, 25% down, 780 credit
- Portfolio jumbo rate: **6.75%** (0.50% below standard jumbo, relationship discount)
- Stock comp income counted (Wells understands RSUs, options)
- **Portfolio jumbo wins** for high-net-worth clients with banking relationship

| **Conventional** | 6.375%–6.75% | 3%–20% | 620+ | Loan ≤$806,500, 740+ credit, 5%–20% down |
| **High-Balance** | 6.50%–7.00% | 3%–20% | 620+ | Loan $806,500–$1,149,825 (most CA), 680+ credit |
| **Jumbo** | 6.75%–7.50% | 10%–20% | 700+ | Loan >$1,149,825, 740+ credit, 20% down, rate-shop brokers |

**Key takeaways**:

1. **Government loans beat conventional** (USDA, VA, FHA 0.25%–0.50% lower) but have trade-offs (MIP, funding fees, income limits)
2. **High-balance conforming saves 0.50%–0.75% vs. jumbo** on $800K–1.15M California loans
3. **Credit score impact is massive** on large loans (720 vs. 780 = 0.375%, costs $300+/month on $1.2M loan)
4. **Rate shopping essential** for jumbo (0.375%–0.75% spread), important for conforming (0.25%–0.50% spread)

## Bottom Line: Match Loan Type to Your California Scenario

**Don't default to conventional**—California's loan landscape offers:
- **USDA** (if rural + low income) = 6.00%–6.375%, 0% down
- **VA** (if veteran) = 6.125%–6.50%, 0% down, no PMI
- **FHA** (if credit <680 or only 3.5% down) = 6.25%–6.625%
- **High-balance conforming** (if loan $806,500–1.15M) = 6.50%–7.00%, avoid jumbo rates
- **Jumbo** (if loan >$1.15M) = 6.75%–7.50%, **MUST rate-shop brokers**
