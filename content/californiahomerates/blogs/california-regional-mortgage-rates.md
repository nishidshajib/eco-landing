## Why California Mortgage Rates Vary by Region

California is **not a single mortgage market**—it's **six distinct regional markets** with different lender competition, property values, and rate pricing:

1. **Bay Area** (SF, San Jose, Oakland) — **Lowest rates** (6.375%–6.625% conforming, 6.875%–7.125% jumbo)
2. **Los Angeles & Orange County** — **Very competitive** (6.375%–6.75% conforming, 6.875%–7.25% jumbo)
3. **San Diego** — **Competitive** (6.50%–6.875% conforming, 7.00%–7.375% jumbo)
4. **Sacramento & Central Valley** — **Moderate pricing** (6.50%–6.875% conforming, 7.125%–7.50% jumbo)
5. **Inland Empire** (Riverside, San Bernardino) — **Higher rates** (6.625%–7.00% conforming, 7.25%–7.625% jumbo)
6. **Wine Country & North Coast** (Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino) — **Highest rates** (6.625%–7.00% conforming, 7.25%–7.75% jumbo)

**Rate spread across California**: **0.25%–0.375%** (Bay Area to Inland Empire for same borrower, same loan). On $900K loan, 0.25% = **$156/month**, $9,360 over 5 years. On $1.5M jumbo, 0.375% = **$391/month**, $23,460 over 5 years.

**Why regional rate differences exist**:

- **Lender competition**: Bay Area has 60+ active lenders (brokers, banks, credit unions) competing for business → razor-thin margins. Inland Empire has 20 lenders → less competition, higher rates.
- **Loan volume**: Bay Area lenders close 10x more loans than Inland Empire lenders → wholesale pricing discounts, economies of scale.
- **Borrower profiles**: Bay Area tech workers (W2, 780+ credit, large down payments) = lower risk → lower rates. Inland Empire buyers (lower credit, smaller down payments) = higher risk → higher rates.
- **Property types**: Bay Area = high-balance conforming + jumbo dominate (competitive pricing). Inland Empire = FHA/VA dominate (fewer lenders, less competition).

**Bottom line**: **Where you buy in California affects your rate as much as your credit score**. Shopping brokers (who access 40+ lenders statewide) eliminates regional rate disadvantages.

## 1. Bay Area (SF, San Jose, Oakland, Peninsula)

### **Market Overview**

**Median home price**: **$1.5M** (San Francisco), **$1.8M** (San Jose/Palo Alto), **$1.2M** (Oakland)

**Dominant loan types**:
- **High-balance conforming** ($800K–$1,149,825): 35% of market
- **Jumbo** ($1.15M–$3M+): 45% of market
- **Conventional conforming** (<$806,500): 15% of market
- **FHA/VA**: <5% (median price too high for government loans)

**Lender competition**: **Highest in California**
- **60+ mortgage brokers** (specialize in tech worker stock comp, jumbo loans)
- **40+ banks/credit unions** (Wells Fargo, Chase, BofA, Union Bank, First Republic—RIP, local CUs)
- **20+ wholesale lenders** competing for broker business (UWM, Pennymac, Rocket Pro TPO)

**Why Bay Area has lowest rates**:

1. **Intense broker competition**: 60+ brokers fighting for same borrowers → undercutting each other by 0.125%–0.25%
2. **High loan volume**: Bay Area lenders close 15,000+ loans/month → wholesale lenders offer volume discounts
3. **Low-risk borrowers**: Tech workers (W2, 780+ credit, 20%+ down, $200K+ income) = best pricing tier
4. **Jumbo lender concentration**: 15+ jumbo lenders compete for $1.5M–3M loans → jumbo rates only 0.375%–0.50% above conforming (vs. 0.75% in Inland Empire)

### **Current Bay Area Mortgage Rates (January 2026)**

**Conforming** (up to $806,500):
- **Broker wholesale pricing**: 6.375%–6.50% (740+ credit, 20% down)
- **Bank retail pricing**: 6.625%–6.75% (same borrower)
- **Spread**: 0.25% (brokers undercut banks)

**High-balance conforming** ($806,500–$1,149,825):
- **Broker wholesale**: 6.50%–6.625%
- **Bank retail**: 6.75%–6.875%
- **Spread**: 0.25%

**Jumbo** ($1.15M–$3M):
- **Broker wholesale**: 6.875%–7.125% (740+ credit, 20% down)
- **Bank retail (Wells, Chase)**: 7.25%–7.50%
- **Portfolio lenders (relationship banking)**: 6.75%–7.00% (for high-net-worth clients with $5M+ investments)
- **Spread**: 0.375% (brokers beat banks, portfolio beats brokers for ultra-wealthy)

### **Bay Area Rate Shopping Strategy**

✅ **Work with brokers**: Bay Area brokers access 40+ wholesale lenders, compare rates daily, beat bank retail by 0.25%–0.375%

✅ **Leverage tech worker programs**: Brokers specializing in stock comp underwriting (RSUs, options, ESPP) get better jumbo rates (know how to count unvested RSUs, lenders trust their files)

✅ **Check portfolio lenders for jumbo**: If you have $5M+ in investments, Wells Fargo Wealth Management or BofA Preferred Rewards offer **6.75%–7.00% jumbo rates** (0.25%–0.50% below retail)

✅ **Rate-shop aggressively**: Bay Area rate spread (highest to lowest lender) = **0.375%–0.50%** on jumbo loans. Get Loan Estimates from 3–5 brokers + 1–2 banks, pick lowest APR.

**Example: San Jose Tech Worker**
- Purchase price: $1.8M (San Jose)
- Down payment: 25% ($450K, stock comp liquidation)
- Loan amount: $1,350,000 (jumbo)
- Credit: 780

**Bank (Wells Fargo retail)**:
- Rate: **7.375%**, monthly payment: **$9,370**

**Mortgage broker (shops 40 lenders, finds Pennymac jumbo)**:
- Rate: **6.875%**, monthly payment: **$8,875**

**Savings**: $495/month, **$29,700 over 5 years**

**Bay Area takeaway**: **Brokers dominate Bay Area jumbo pricing**. Banks can't compete (retail margins too high). If you use bank, you overpay 0.375%–0.50%.

## 2. Los Angeles & Orange County

### **Market Overview**

**Median home price**: **$900K** (Los Angeles County), **$1.1M** (Orange County)

**Dominant loan types**:
- **High-balance conforming** ($800K–$1,149,825): 40% of market
- **Conventional conforming** (<$806,500): 30% of market
- **Jumbo** ($1.15M–$2M+): 20% of market
- **FHA/VA**: 10% (first-time buyers, military)

**Lender competition**: **Very high**
- **50+ mortgage brokers** (generalists + jumbo specialists + Latino-focused lenders)
- **35+ banks/credit unions** (national banks + local CUs like Kinecta, Logix, Wescom)
- **25+ wholesale lenders** competing for broker business

**Why LA/OC rates are competitive**:

1. **Diverse lender base**: National banks + local CUs + 50 brokers = intense competition
2. **High loan volume**: LA/OC close 20,000+ loans/month (more than Bay Area) → economies of scale
3. **Broker market share**: 60% of LA/OC borrowers use brokers (vs. 40% banks) → brokers drive pricing down

### **Current LA/OC Mortgage Rates (January 2026)**

**Conforming** (up to $806,500):
- **Broker wholesale**: 6.375%–6.625%
- **Bank retail**: 6.625%–6.75%
- **Credit union**: 6.50%–6.75% (members only, competitive with brokers)
- **Spread**: 0.125%–0.25%

**High-balance conforming** ($806,500–$1,149,825):
- **Broker wholesale**: 6.50%–6.75%
- **Bank retail**: 6.75%–6.875%
- **Spread**: 0.125%–0.25%

**Jumbo** ($1.15M–$2M):

- **Bank retail**: 7.125%–7.50%
- **Portfolio lenders**: 6.875%–7.125% (relationship banking)
- **Spread**: 0.25%–0.375%

### **LA/OC Rate Shopping Strategy**

✅ **Brokers + credit unions**: Get quotes from 2 brokers (wholesale pricing) + 1 credit union (if you're a member). Credit unions like **Kinecta, Logix, Wescom** offer competitive conforming rates (6.50%–6.75%, match brokers).

✅ **Shop Latino-focused lenders** (if Hispanic borrower): LA/OC has Spanish-speaking brokers specializing in Latino buyers (CalHFA, ITIN loans, foreign income documentation). Example: **Mortgage Capital Associates, Latino Lending Network**.

✅ **Avoid retail banks for jumbo**: Wells/Chase/BofA retail rates are 7.25%–7.50% (jumbo). Brokers get 6.875%–7.125% (0.375% lower).

**Example: Orange County Purchase**
- Purchase price: $1.2M (Irvine)
- Down payment: 20% ($240K)
- Loan amount: $960,000 (high-balance conforming)
- Credit: 740

**Bank (Chase retail)**:
- Rate: **6.875%**, monthly payment: **$6,322**

**Credit union (Logix FCU, member)**:
- Rate: **6.625%**, monthly payment: **$6,164**

**Mortgage broker (shops 40 lenders, finds UWM high-balance)**:
- Rate: **6.50%**, monthly payment: **$6,084**

**Savings** (broker vs. bank): $238/month, **$14,280 over 5 years**

**LA/OC takeaway**: **Credit unions competitive for conforming** (members only). **Brokers win for high-balance + jumbo** (0.25%–0.375% lower than banks).

## 3. San Diego

### **Market Overview**

**Median home price**: **$850K** (San Diego County)

**Dominant loan types**:

**Lender competition**: **High** (but less than Bay Area/LA)

- **15+ wholesale lenders**

**Why San Diego rates are 0.125%–0.25% higher than Bay Area/LA**:

1. **Less lender competition**: 35 brokers (vs. 60 in Bay Area) → less rate undercutting
2. **Military market concentration**: VA loans dominate (20% market share) → lenders focus on VA, less competition for conventional/jumbo
3. **Smaller jumbo market**: Only 5% of loans are jumbo (vs. 45% in Bay Area) → fewer jumbo lenders, higher jumbo rates

### **Current San Diego Mortgage Rates (January 2026)**

**Conforming** (up to $806,500):
- **Broker wholesale**: 6.50%–6.75%
- **Bank retail**: 6.75%–6.875%
- **Credit union (Navy Federal, SDFCU)**: 6.625%–6.875%
- **Spread**: 0.125%–0.25%

**High-balance conforming** ($806,500–$1,149,825):
- **Broker wholesale**: 6.625%–6.875%
- **Bank retail**: 6.875%–7.00%
- **Spread**: 0.125%–0.25%

**VA** (0% down, military):

**Jumbo** ($1.15M–$2M):
- **Broker wholesale**: 7.00%–7.375%
- **Bank retail**: 7.375%–7.625%
- **Spread**: 0.375%

### **San Diego Rate Shopping Strategy**

✅ **VA loans: Use VA specialists**: San Diego has highest VA loan volume in California (military bases). **Veterans United, Navy Federal, USAA** offer **6.125%–6.375%** VA rates (0.25% below general lenders).

✅ **Conforming: Shop brokers + Navy Federal**: If you're military/veteran, **Navy Federal CU** offers competitive conforming rates (6.625%–6.875%). If not military, brokers beat banks by 0.125%–0.25%.

✅ **Jumbo: Brokers essential**: San Diego jumbo market is small (5% of loans). Only 8–10 jumbo lenders active. Brokers access all of them, banks offer 1. **Brokers win by 0.375%–0.50%** on jumbo.

**Example: San Diego Military Buyer (VA Loan)**
- Purchase price: $800K (Chula Vista)
- Down payment: 0% (VA loan)

- Rate: **6.125%**, monthly payment: **$4,853**

**Savings**: $206/month, **$12,360 over 5 years**

**San Diego takeaway**: **VA specialists dominate military market** (0.25% lower rates). **Brokers win for conforming/high-balance** (0.125%–0.25% lower than banks). **Jumbo rates 0.125%–0.25% higher than Bay Area/LA** (less competition).
