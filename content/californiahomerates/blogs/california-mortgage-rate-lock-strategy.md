## What Is a Mortgage Rate Lock?

A **rate lock** is a lender's **written commitment** to honor a specific interest rate for a set period (typically 30, 45, or 60 days) while your loan processes through underwriting, appraisal, and closing.

**Without a rate lock**: Your rate **floats** (changes daily based on market conditions). If bond yields rise 0.50% during your 35-day escrow, your rate rises 0.50% = $350–500/month more on California loans.

**With a rate lock**: Your rate is **frozen** for the lock period. Market rates can rise 1%, your rate stays locked. If rates drop 0.50%, you're **stuck with higher locked rate** (unless you have float-down option).

**California rate lock specifics**:

- **Standard lock period**: 30–60 days (lender determines based on loan complexity)
- **Lock fees**: 30-day lock is **free** (built into quoted rate). 45-day lock adds **0.125%** to rate. 60-day lock adds **0.25%** to rate.
- **Lock extensions**: If closing delays beyond lock expiration, lenders charge **0.125%–0.25% per 15 days** or force you to re-lock at current market rate.
- **Float-down options**: Pay **0.125% upfront** for **one-time** float-down if rates drop 0.375%+ during lock period.

**Why rate locks matter in California**: Loan amounts are **$600K–1.5M+** (vs. $300K–400K national average). A 0.125% rate increase on $1M loan = **$694/year** or **$58/month**. A 0.50% increase = **$278/month**, $16,680 over 5 years. **Rate lock timing is critical** on California loans.

## When to Lock Your California Mortgage Rate

### **Lock Immediately If:**

✅ **You're happy with the rate** (meets your budget, competitive vs. other lenders)  
✅ **Rates are rising** (Fed hiking, bond yields climbing, mortgage rates up 0.125%+ in past week)  
✅ **You're <45 days from closing** (tight timeline, can't afford rate increase risk)  
✅ **You're risk-averse** (prefer certainty over gambling on rate drops)  
✅ **Purchase contract** (vs. refinance): Purchase has hard closing deadline, can't delay if rates spike

**Example: Lock at application**
- Borrower applies for $900K loan (San Diego)
- Rate quoted: **6.50%**, monthly payment $5,686
- Borrower locks for **45 days** (+0.125% lock fee, so actual rate 6.625%)
- 2 weeks later, Fed holds rates, bond yields rise 0.25% → market rates now **6.75%**
- **Borrower saved 0.125%** by locking early = $78/month, $4,680 over 5 years

---

### **Float (Don't Lock) If:**

❌ **You're >60 days from closing** (too early to lock, lenders charge 0.375%+ for 90-day locks)  
❌ **Rates are falling** (Fed cutting rates, bond yields dropping, mortgage rates down 0.125%+ in past week)  
❌ **You have float-down option** (paid 0.125% upfront for one-time re-lock if rates drop 0.375%+)  
❌ **Refinance** (vs. purchase): Refis have flexible closing timelines, can wait for better rates  
❌ **You're a gambler** (willing to risk rate increase to chase rate decrease)

**Example: Float backfires**
- Borrower applies for $1.2M jumbo loan (Bay Area)
- Rate quoted: **7.00%**, monthly payment $7,988
- Borrower floats (doesn't lock), expects rates to drop
- 3 weeks later, inflation report comes in hot, Fed signals rate hikes → market rates spike to **7.50%**
- **Borrower loses 0.50%** by floating = $333/month, $19,980 over 5 years
- Now must lock at **7.50%** or wait (gambling rates drop back to 7.00%)

**Floating is gambling**—you win if rates drop, lose if rates rise. Most California buyers **lock at application** (purchase timelines are fixed, can't afford rate spike risk).

---

## California Rate Lock Periods: 30, 45, or 60 Days?

### **30-Day Lock (Free, High Risk)**

**Cost**: **Free** (no rate premium, quoted rate is 30-day lock rate)

**Timeline**: Covers **25–30 day closings** (simple conforming loans, W2 income, clean title, no appraisal issues)

**California closing reality**: **Average 32 days** (per California Association of Realtors 2025 data). **30-day locks expire before closing** in 40%+ of California purchases.

**Risk**: If closing delays to day 31+, lender charges **0.125%–0.25% extension fee** or forces you to **re-lock at current market rate** (which could be 0.25%–0.75% higher if rates spiked).

**When to use 30-day lock**:
- ✅ **Refinance** (you control timeline, can accelerate closing)
- ✅ **Cash purchase converting to mortgage** (no contingencies, fast close)
- ✅ **All-contingencies-removed purchase** (appraisal done, underwriting clear to close, 10 days to closing)

**When to avoid 30-day lock**:
- ❌ **Typical California purchase** (32-day average = lock expires before closing)
- ❌ **Jumbo loans** (underwriting takes 5–10 days longer than conforming)
- ❌ **Self-employed income** (lenders request extra docs, delays closing)

**Example: 30-day lock disaster**
- Borrower locks 30 days, quoted **6.50%**
- Appraisal delayed 7 days (appraiser backlog in Bay Area)
- Closing pushes to **day 35**
- Lock expired day 30 → lender re-locks at **current market rate: 6.875%**
- **Borrower loses 0.375%** = $248/month on $1M loan

**California loan officer advice**: **Never use 30-day lock** unless you're 100% certain closing happens in 25 days. The 0.125% savings ($69/month on $800K loan) isn't worth re-lock risk.

---

### **45-Day Lock (Standard California, Low Risk)**

**Cost**: **+0.125% to rate** (vs. 30-day lock)

**Timeline**: Covers **30–42 day closings** (most California purchases, conforming/high-balance loans, W2 income, standard underwriting)

**California closing reality**: **45-day lock covers 80%+ of California purchases** (32-day average + 13-day buffer for minor delays).

**Risk**: **Low**. If closing delays to day 46–50, lender charges small extension fee (0.125% for 15 more days). Catastrophic delays (appraisal issues, title problems, income re-verification) can still cause lock expiration, but rare.

**When to use 45-day lock**:
- ✅ **Most California purchases** (conforming, high-balance, FHA, VA loans)
- ✅ **W2 income** (standard underwriting, predictable timeline)
- ✅ **Normal appraisal market** (appraisers available within 7–10 days)
- ✅ **Risk-averse buyers** (pay 0.125% for peace of mind)

**Cost vs. benefit** ($900K loan, San Diego):
- 30-day lock: **6.50%**, $5,686/month
- 45-day lock: **6.625%**, $5,764/month
- **Extra cost**: $78/month for 45-day lock
- **Break-even**: If rates rise 0.125%+ during escrow, 45-day lock saves money. If rates stay flat or drop, you overpaid $78/month.

**Example: 45-day lock saves borrower**
- Borrower locks 45 days at **6.625%** (paid 0.125% premium vs. 30-day 6.50%)
- Week 2: Fed keeps rates steady, bond yields rise 0.25% → market rates now **6.75%**
- Week 4: Appraisal delayed 5 days (appraiser COVID case)
- Week 5: Closing happens day 37
- **Borrower saved 0.125%** vs. re-locking at 6.75% (the 0.125% lock premium paid for itself)

**California loan officer recommendation**: **45-day lock is default** for 90% of California purchases. The 0.125% cost ($69–139/month on $800K–1.5M loans) is cheap insurance against re-lock risk.

---

### **60-Day Lock (Jumbo/Complex Files, Expensive)**

**Cost**: **+0.25% to rate** (vs. 30-day lock)

**Timeline**: Covers **45–58 day closings** (jumbo loans, self-employed, stock comp income, multiple properties, new construction, complex underwriting)

**California jumbo/complex reality**: Jumbo loans average **38–45 days** to close (extra underwriting, reserves verification, appraisal review). Self-employed loans add **7–14 days** (CPA letters, business tax returns, P&L verification).

**Risk**: **Very low** for expiration. But **high cost** if closing happens in 30 days (you paid 0.25% for 60-day lock, only needed 30 days = overpaid).

**When to use 60-day lock**:
- ✅ **Jumbo loans** ($1.5M+, complex underwriting)
- ✅ **Self-employed borrowers** (bank statement loans, CPA verification, extra doc requests)
- ✅ **Stock comp income** (RSU verification, IPO lockup periods, lender unfamiliar with tech comp)
- ✅ **Multiple properties** (portfolio underwriting, cross-collateralization, reserves across accounts)
- ✅ **New construction** (builder delays, final inspections, TCO/occupancy permit timing)
- ✅ **Title issues** (liens, easements, boundary disputes requiring resolution)

**When to avoid 60-day lock**:
- ❌ **Simple conforming loans** (W2 income, 740+ credit, clean title → 60-day lock is overkill, costs 0.25% unnecessarily)
- ❌ **Refinances** (you control timeline, can close in 25–30 days if needed)

**Cost vs. benefit** ($1.5M jumbo loan, San Francisco):
- 30-day lock: **7.00%**, $9,975/month
- 60-day lock: **7.25%**, $10,238/month
- **Extra cost**: $263/month for 60-day lock
- **Break-even**: If loan takes 35+ days to close AND rates rise 0.25%+ during escrow, 60-day lock saves money. Otherwise, overpaid.

**Example: 60-day lock necessary**
- Borrower: Self-employed tech consultant, $1.8M jumbo loan (Palo Alto)
- Income: 1099s + bank statements + stock comp (RSUs)
- Locks 60 days at **7.25%** (vs. 30-day 7.00%)
- Week 3: Underwriter requests 2 years business bank statements (not initially provided)
- Week 5: RSU verification delayed (company HR slow to respond)
- Week 7: Appraisal review (jumbo appraisals require 2nd review)
- Week 8: Closing happens day 52
- **60-day lock saved borrower**—would have expired with 30-day or 45-day lock, forced re-lock at higher rate

**California loan officer advice**: **60-day lock for jumbo + self-employed + stock comp**. The 0.25% cost ($263/month on $1.5M loan) is cheap insurance vs. re-lock disaster (if rates spike 0.50%, you lose $417/month).

---

## Float-Down Options (Protect Against Rate Drops)

**Float-down** = Pay **0.125% upfront** for **one-time** option to re-lock at lower rate if market rates drop **0.375%+** during lock period.

**How float-down works**:
- You lock rate at **6.75%** + pay 0.125% float-down fee (actual rate **6.875%**)
- If market rates drop to **6.375%** (0.50% drop, exceeds 0.375% threshold), you **re-lock at 6.375%** (one-time float-down)
- If market rates drop to **6.625%** (0.125% drop, doesn't exceed 0.375% threshold), you're **stuck at 6.875%**
- If market rates rise to **7.00%**, you're **locked at 6.875%** (protected from increase, but can't use float-down)

**Float-down cost**: **0.125% upfront** = $1,000 on $800K loan, $1,500 on $1.2M loan

**Float-down restrictions**:
- **One-time only**: Can't float down twice (if rates drop 0.50%, then drop another 0.50%, you only get one float-down)
- **Minimum drop threshold**: Most lenders require **0.375%–0.50% drop** to activate float-down
- **Timing window**: Float-down must happen **before closing** (can't float down after rate lock expires)

### **When Float-Down Makes Sense**

✅ **Fed is actively cutting rates** (FOMC meeting in 2 weeks, market expects 0.25%–0.50% cut)  
✅ **Bond yields falling rapidly** (10-year Treasury down 0.30%+ in past month)  
✅ **You're locking 45–60 days** (longer lock = more time for rates to drop 0.375%+)  
✅ **You're risk-averse but optimistic** (want lock protection, but believe rates will drop)

### **When Float-Down Is a Waste**

❌ **Fed is hiking rates** (rates rising, not falling—float-down is useless)  
❌ **Rates are stable** (bond yields flat, Fed on hold—unlikely to drop 0.375%+)  
❌ **You're locking 30 days** (short window, rates rarely drop 0.375% in 30 days)  
❌ **You're a gambler** (if you truly believe rates will drop 0.50%+, just float—don't lock at all)

**Example: Float-down wins**
- October 2025: Fed signals rate cuts, borrower locks $1M loan at **6.75%** + 0.125% float-down = **6.875%**
- November 2025: Fed cuts 0.50%, bond yields drop, market rates fall to **6.25%**
- Borrower activates float-down, re-locks at **6.25%**
- **Saved 0.625%** vs. original 6.875% lock = $413/month

**Example: Float-down loses**
- Borrower locks $900K loan at **6.50%** + 0.125% float-down = **6.625%**
- Rates stay flat (Fed holds, bond yields stable)
- Borrower closes at **6.625%** (overpaid 0.125% for float-down option that was never used)
- **Wasted $1,125 upfront** + $78/month higher rate (0.125%) for life of loan

**California reality**: **Float-down is rarely worth it**. Rates need to drop 0.375%+ in 30–60 days (rare). If you believe rates will drop that much, **just float** (don't lock at all). Float-down is for indecisive borrowers who want protection both ways—costs 0.125%, rarely pays off.

## Rate Lock Extensions (When Closing Delays)

**Rate lock extension** = Pay **0.125%–0.25%** to extend lock for **another 15–30 days** if closing delays beyond original lock expiration.

**Why closings delay in California**:
- **Appraisal backlog** (appraiser shortage, 10–21 day delays in Bay Area/LA)
- **Title issues** (liens, easements, probate, boundary disputes)
- **Underwriting conditions** (lender requests extra docs, income re-verification, asset sourcing)
- **Seller delays** (seller needs more time to move out, requests rent-back)
- **Buyer delays** (buyer loses job, credit score drops, debt increases mid-process)

**Extension fees**:
- **15-day extension**: 0.125% (= $1,000 on $800K loan)
- **30-day extension**: 0.25% (= $2,000 on $800K loan)
- **Per-day extension**: Some lenders charge 0.01%–0.02% per day (= $80–160/day on $800K loan)

**Negotiating extensions**:
- **Lender error** (lender caused delay—slow underwriting, appraisal wasn't ordered on time): **Free extension** (lender eats cost)
- **Borrower error** (borrower missed doc deadlines, changed jobs mid-process): **Borrower pays extension fee**
- **Third-party error** (appraiser delayed, title company delayed): **Negotiate 50/50 split** (lender and borrower split extension cost)

**Example: Extension due to appraisal delay**
- Borrower locks 45 days at **6.50%**
- Day 25: Appraisal ordered (should have been day 7—lender error)
- Day 40: Appraisal comes back, underwriting approves
- Day 46: Ready to close, but lock expired day 45
- **Lender error** (delayed appraisal order) → lender provides **free 15-day extension** at **6.50%**

**Example: Extension due to borrower delay**
- Borrower locks 45 days at **6.75%**
- Day 20: Underwriter requests 2 months bank statements (borrower takes 10 days to provide)
- Day 48: Ready to close, but lock expired day 45
- **Borrower error** (slow to provide docs) → borrower pays **0.125% extension fee** ($1,000 on $800K loan)

**California loan officer advice**: **45-day lock minimizes extension risk**. If you cheap out with 30-day lock and closing delays to day 35, you pay 0.125%–0.25% extension fee—same cost as just doing 45-day lock upfront.

## Lock vs. Float: California Market Timing Strategy

### **Scenario 1: Rising Rate Environment (Lock Immediately)**

**Market conditions**:
- Fed hiking rates (0.25%–0.50% per quarter)
- 10-year Treasury yield rising (up 0.30%+ in past month)
- Mortgage rates climbing (up 0.125%+ per week)

**Strategy**: **Lock at application** (45-day lock for purchases, 30-day for refis)

**Why**: Rates are trending up. Floating = gambling rates will reverse course (unlikely). Locking protects you from further increases.

**Example**:
- January 2026: Mortgage rates 6.50% (California conforming)
- Fed signals more rate hikes, bond yields rise
- February 2026: Rates 6.75%
- March 2026: Rates 7.00%
- **Borrower who locked at 6.50% in January saved 0.50%** vs. floating = $347/month on $1M loan

---

### **Scenario 2: Falling Rate Environment (Float or Use Float-Down)**

**Market conditions**:
- Fed cutting rates (0.25%–0.50% per quarter)
- 10-year Treasury yield falling (down 0.30%+ in past month)
- Mortgage rates dropping (down 0.125%+ per week)

**Strategy**: **Float** (don't lock) OR **lock with float-down** (if risk-averse)

**Why**: Rates are trending down. Locking traps you at higher rate. Floating lets you capture lower rates as they fall.

**Risk**: If Fed pauses cuts or bond yields spike (inflation report, geopolitical event), rates reverse course—you lose floating bet.

**Example**:
- October 2025: Mortgage rates 7.00% (California conforming)
- Fed cuts 0.50%, signals more cuts
- November 2025: Rates 6.625%
- December 2025: Rates 6.25%
- **Borrower who floated saved 0.75%** vs. locking at 7.00% = $521/month on $1M loan

**Caution**: Floating is **high risk** on purchases (closing deadlines are fixed, can't delay if rates spike). Floating works better on **refinances** (you can wait for rates to drop, no purchase contract deadline).

---

### **Scenario 3: Stable/Volatile Rate Environment (Lock 45 Days)**

**Market conditions**:
- Fed on hold (no hikes, no cuts)
- 10-year Treasury yield choppy (up 0.10%, down 0.10%, no clear trend)
- Mortgage rates range-bound (6.50%–6.75%, bouncing daily)

**Strategy**: **Lock 45 days at application**

**Why**: Rates could go either way (up 0.25% or down 0.25%). Locking protects downside (if rates rise), you give up upside (if rates fall). Most California buyers prefer certainty over gambling.

**Example**:
- Rates today: **6.625%** (California conforming)
- Borrower locks 45 days at **6.75%** (pays 0.125% for 45-day lock)
- Week 3: Rates spike to 6.875% (inflation report hot)
- Week 5: Rates drop to 6.50% (Fed hints at cuts)
- Week 6: Borrower closes at **6.75%** (locked rate)
- **Result**: Borrower avoided 6.875% spike, but missed 6.50% drop. **Certainty over volatility**.

## Common California Rate Lock Mistakes

### **Mistake 1: Locking Too Early (>60 Days from Closing)**

**Error**: Borrower locks 90 days before closing (new construction, long escrow)

**Cost**: Lenders charge **0.375%–0.50%** for 90-day locks (vs. 0% for 30-day). On $1M loan, 0.50% = **$347/month** wasted.

**Fix**: **Wait to lock** until you're 45–60 days from closing. If builder delays construction, you're stuck with expensive 90-day lock + extension fees.

---

### **Mistake 2: Locking 30 Days on Complex Loan**

**Error**: Jumbo loan, self-employed income, locks 30 days (free lock)

**Cost**: Closing takes 42 days (underwriting delays), lock expires day 30, borrower re-locks at **+0.375% higher rate** = $313/month more on $1.2M loan

**Fix**: **60-day lock for jumbo/complex loans** (pay 0.25% upfront = $208/month, cheaper than re-lock risk)

---

### **Mistake 3: Floating in Rising Rate Market**

**Error**: Borrower floats (doesn't lock), rates rise 0.50% during escrow

**Cost**: $347/month on $1M loan, $20,820 over 5 years

**Fix**: **Lock at application** unless you have strong conviction rates will drop 0.375%+ (rare)

---

### **Mistake 4: Paying for Float-Down in Stable Market**

**Error**: Borrower pays 0.125% for float-down, rates stay flat, closes at 0.125% higher rate (wasted float-down fee)

**Cost**: $69/month on $800K loan (0.125% higher rate for entire loan term)

**Fix**: **Skip float-down** unless Fed is actively cutting rates (0.25%–0.50% per quarter) and you expect 0.50%+ drop during lock period

---

### **Mistake 5: Not Getting Rate Lock in Writing**

**Error**: Loan officer verbally says "you're locked at 6.50%" but doesn't send written lock confirmation

**Cost**: Closing day, lender says "we don't have you locked, current rate is 6.875%" (borrower has no proof of 6.50% lock)

**Fix**: **Demand written rate lock confirmation** (email or signed lock agreement) within 24 hours of verbal lock. If lender won't provide written confirmation, **walk away** (predatory lender).

---

## California Rate Lock Checklist

Before locking your California mortgage rate:

☑ **Know your timeline**: 30-day lock (refis, fast closings), 45-day lock (standard CA purchases), 60-day lock (jumbo/complex)

☑ **Check market conditions**: Rising rates = lock immediately. Falling rates = float or lock with float-down. Stable rates = lock 45 days.

☑ **Get lock in writing**: Email confirmation with locked rate, lock period, lock fees, expiration date

☑ **Understand lock fees**: 30-day = free, 45-day = +0.125%, 60-day = +0.25%, float-down = +0.125%

☑ **Ask about extensions**: What happens if closing delays? Free extension if lender error? Extension fees if borrower/third-party error?

☑ **Compare lenders**: Some lenders offer **free 45-day locks** (no 0.125% premium). Shop 3–5 lenders before locking.

☑ **Know float-down rules**: Minimum rate drop (0.375%–0.50%), one-time only, expires at closing

☑ **Lock at right time**: Not too early (>60 days = expensive), not too late (<10 days = risky if rates spike)

---

## Bottom Line: 45-Day Lock Is California Standard

**California loan officers recommend**:

- **Purchases**: **45-day lock** (covers 32-day average + 13-day buffer)
- **Refinances**: **30-day lock** (you control timeline, can close fast)
- **Jumbo/complex**: **60-day lock** (self-employed, stock comp, multiple properties need extra time)
- **Float-down**: **Skip it** (rarely pays off unless Fed is actively cutting rates 0.25%–0.50% per quarter)

**Rate lock costs on California loans**:
- 30-day lock: **Free** ($0 upfront, but high expiration risk)
- 45-day lock: **0.125%** ($69/month on $800K loan, $139/month on $1.6M loan)
- 60-day lock: **0.25%** ($139/month on $800K loan, $278/month on $1.6M loan)

**The 0.125%–0.25% lock premium is cheap insurance** vs. re-lock risk (if rates spike 0.50%, you lose $347–695/month on California loans).
