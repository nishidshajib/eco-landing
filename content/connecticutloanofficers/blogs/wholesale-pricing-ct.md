Connecticut mortgage brokers access **wholesale pricing** that runs 0.125%–0.375% below retail bank rates on identical scenarios. Wholesale pricing is the primary reason brokers can beat single-lender retail offers.

## What Is Wholesale Pricing?

Wholesale pricing is discounted mortgage rates offered to brokers who originate loans in volume.

**Why it’s lower**:
- Lenders save on marketing costs
- Brokers deliver pre-qualified borrowers
- Higher volume = lower per-loan cost for lenders

---

## Same Lender, Lower Rate

**Example** ($450K conventional):
- Retail bank rate: 6.750%
- Broker wholesale rate: 6.500%
- **Savings**: $76/month ($912/year)

---

## Wholesale Rate Sheet Access

Brokers use pricing platforms like:
- Optimal Blue
- Mortech
- LenderPrice

These tools compare 20+ lenders in real time to identify the lowest APR combination.

## Wholesale Savings Example

| Lender Channel | Rate | APR | Fees |
|----------------|------|-----|------|
| Retail Bank | 6.750% | 6.95% | $6,500 |
| Broker Wholesale | 6.500% | 6.65% | $2,250 |

**Total Savings**: ~$9,000 over 5 years (rate + fee difference)

---

## When Wholesale Wins

- Standard conforming loans
- Strong credit (720+)
- Borrowers comparing multiple lenders

## When Wholesale May Not Win

- Jumbo loans with specialized portfolio programs
- Credit union member pricing that matches wholesale

---

## Borrower-Paid vs Lender-Paid Options

Brokers can be compensated in two ways:

1) **Borrower-paid**: Lower rate, upfront fee
2) **Lender-paid**: Slightly higher rate, no upfront fee

Ask brokers to show both options and compare breakeven timelines.

## Bottom Line

Wholesale pricing is the broker advantage. Connecticut borrowers often save **0.125%–0.375%** on rates plus lower fees compared to retail banks.
