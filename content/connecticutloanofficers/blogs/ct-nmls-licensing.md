Connecticut requires all mortgage loan originators (MLOs) to hold active NMLS licenses. Licensing provides regulatory oversight and consumer protections—making verification a critical first step before sharing financial details.

## Connecticut NMLS Licensing Overview

### What NMLS Licensing Means

**NMLS** (Nationwide Multistate Licensing System) is the federal registry for mortgage loan officers. Connecticut requires:

- Active NMLS license
- Annual continuing education
- State registration and renewal
- Background checks and financial responsibility standards

## How to Verify a Connecticut Loan Officer

### Step 1: Ask for NMLS Number

Any licensed loan officer should provide their NMLS number immediately.

### Step 2: Search NMLSConsumerAccess.org

Go to [NMLSConsumerAccess.org](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/) and enter the officer’s name or NMLS number.

### Step 3: Confirm Active License

Check:
- License status (Active)
- Years licensed
- Disciplinary history

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Refuses to provide NMLS number
- License status shows inactive/suspended
- Multiple disciplinary actions

---

## Why Licensing Protects Borrowers

Licensed MLOs must:
- Follow federal disclosure rules
- Provide Loan Estimates within 3 days
- Maintain ethical standards
- Remain accountable to regulators

Unlicensed operators lack oversight and put borrowers at risk.

Always verify a Connecticut loan officer’s NMLS license before sharing personal financial information. Licensing is a borrower’s best protection against fraud and misinformation.
