## Arizona Jumbo Lending Requires Market Expertise

Arizona’s luxury market spans **Scottsdale**, **Paradise Valley**, **North Phoenix**, and growing high-end pockets in **Chandler** and **Gilbert**. Each area has different property types, HOA requirements, and appraisal dynamics. Choosing a lender who understands these differences is critical for competitive rates and smooth underwriting.

## The 7-Step Lender Selection Checklist

### 1) County & Market Experience
Ask: **How many jumbo loans have you closed in Scottsdale or Paradise Valley in the last 12 months?**

Look for lenders with direct experience in your target market. Appraisal familiarity matters at $1M+ price points.

### 2) Portfolio vs Agency Options
Not every jumbo lender offers portfolio programs. Portfolio lenders can approve complex income, high DTI, or unique properties. Agency jumbo can be cheaper but stricter.

### 3) Rate vs APR Transparency
Always compare **APR**, not just rate. Low rates often hide higher fees—especially on jumbo loans.

### 4) Down Payment Flexibility
Arizona jumbo loans generally require **20% down**. Super jumbo loans may need **25%–30%**. Ask about alternatives if you’re near thresholds.

### 5) HOA and Condo Expertise
Luxury condos in Old Town Scottsdale and North Phoenix require lender experience with HOA documentation and project approval.

### 6) Reserve Requirements
Most jumbo lenders require **6–12 months of reserves**. Portfolio lenders may require 12–24 months for complex scenarios.

### 7) Closing Timeline
Ask about typical closing timelines. Standard jumbo: 30–40 days. Portfolio or complex deals: 40–50 days.
