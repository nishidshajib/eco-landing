## Portfolio vs Agency Jumbo: The Arizona Decision

Arizona buyers often choose between **agency jumbo** (Fannie/Freddie-aligned) and **portfolio jumbo** (held in-house by banks). The right choice depends on income complexity, property type, and how close you are to standard guideline limits.

## Agency Jumbo Loans

**Best for:**
- W-2 income
- 740+ credit
- Standard property types
- Lower DTI (43% or less)

**Advantages:**
- Often slightly lower rates
- Predictable underwriting
- Broad lender availability

**Limitations:**
- Strict documentation rules
- Limited flexibility for complex income
- Condo/HOA issues can trigger denial

## Portfolio Jumbo Loans

**Best for:**
- Self-employed or complex income
- High DTI or asset-based qualifying
- Unique properties or condos
- Faster exceptions on appraisals

**Advantages:**
- Flexible underwriting
- Asset-based options
- Better for non-warrantable condos

**Limitations:**
- Slightly higher rate (0.25%–0.75%)
- Higher reserve requirements

## Arizona-Specific Considerations

### Scottsdale & Paradise Valley
Luxury estates and gated communities often involve higher appraisals and HOA review. Portfolio lenders typically handle these complexities better.

### Phoenix (Arcadia/North Phoenix)
Agency jumbo works well for standard single-family purchases. Portfolio lenders may help with custom builds and complex income.

### New Construction in Chandler/Gilbert
Builder incentives may favor one lender, but comparing portfolio vs agency can save thousands in total cost.

## Example: $1.5M Scottsdale Purchase

**Agency jumbo:**
- Rate: 6.70%
- DTI cap: 43%
- Reserves: 9 months

**Portfolio jumbo:**
- Rate: 6.95%
- DTI cap: 48%
- Reserves: 12 months

If your DTI is 45%, the portfolio option may be the only approval path despite the rate premium.

## The Bottom Line

Agency jumbo works best for clean, straightforward profiles. Portfolio jumbo wins when income is complex or property types are unique. In Arizona, many Scottsdale and Paradise Valley buyers benefit from portfolio flexibility even if rates are slightly higher.
