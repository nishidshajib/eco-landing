## Arizona Jumbo Qualification Overview

Jumbo loans in Arizona start above **$806,550**. Qualification standards are stricter than conforming loans and vary by lender type (agency jumbo vs portfolio). Borrowers should plan for stronger credit, higher reserves, and more detailed income documentation.

## 1) Credit Score Requirements

- **760+**: Best jumbo pricing tiers
- **740–759**: Competitive rates, slight price adjustment
- **720–739**: Moderate rate premium, stricter documentation
- **700–719**: Portfolio lenders only in many cases
- **680–699**: Rare, requires strong compensating factors

## 2) Down Payment Expectations

- **Standard jumbo ($806K–$2M):** 20% down typical
- **Super jumbo ($2M–$5M):** 25%–30% down typical
- **Condos and second homes:** May require 25%+ down

## 3) Debt-to-Income (DTI) Limits

- **Agency jumbo:** 43% DTI max
- **Portfolio jumbo:** 45%–50% possible

Portfolio lenders are essential for borrowers with variable income or complex assets.

## 4) Reserve Requirements

Most jumbo lenders require **6–12 months** of reserves. Portfolio lenders may require **12–24 months** for complex scenarios.

Eligible reserves often include:
- Checking/savings
- Brokerage accounts (typically 70% of balance)
- Retirement assets (typically 60% of balance)

## 5) Income Documentation

- **W-2 borrowers:** 2 years tax returns + recent pay stubs
- **Self-employed:** 2 years personal + business returns, P&L
- **K-1 income:** 2 years K-1s and entity returns
- **Asset-based qualifying:** Assets ÷ 84 months = monthly income

## 6) Property Type Considerations

- **Condos:** HOA review required; non-warrantable projects need portfolio lenders
- **Custom homes:** Appraisal complexity may require specialty lenders
- **New construction:** Builder incentives may impact loan choice

## The Bottom Line

Arizona jumbo qualification requires **strong credit, documented income, and sufficient reserves**. Portfolio lenders provide flexibility for complex income and unique properties, while agency jumbo can deliver the best rates for straightforward profiles.
