Your HELOC offers low interest-only payments of $500/month during the draw period. Sounds great. Then the draw period ends, the repayment period begins, and your payment jumps to $1,800/month. You can't afford it. Now what? This payment shock ruins more HELOC borrowers than rate increases. Here's how to prevent it.

## Understanding the Two HELOC Periods

Most HELOCs have a two-phase structure:

**Draw Period (Typically 5–10 Years)**
- You can borrow and repay freely
- Payments are interest-only
- You only pay interest on money you've drawn
- Payments are typically lowest during this phase

**Repayment Period (Typically 10–20 Years)**
- You can no longer draw new funds
- Payments must include principal + interest
- Payments are typically much higher
- This is when most defaults happen

## How Payments Change: The Real Numbers

**Example HELOC:**
- Credit limit: $150,000
- You draw: $100,000 at 9.25% rate
- Draw period: 10 years
- Repayment period: 15 years

**Draw Period Payment (Interest-Only):**
$100,000 × 9.25% ÷ 12 months = **$770/month**

You're only paying interest. Principal stays at $100,000.

**Repayment Period Payment (Principal + Interest):**
$100,000 amortized over 15 years at 9.25% = **$1,093/month**

Payment increased by $323/month (42% jump).

**But This Gets Worse if Rates Rose:**

Scenario: Prime went from 7.25% to 9.00% during draw period

**Draw Period End:**
- Your HELOC rate: 9.00% + 2.25% margin = 11.25%
- Interest-only payment: $937/month

**Repayment Period (Rate Still 11.25%):**
- Principal + interest over 15 years: **$1,345/month**
- Jump from $937 to $1,345 = $408/month increase (44% jump)

Most people don't budget for this.

## Why Payment Shock Happens

**Reason 1: Simple Miscalculation**
Borrowers focus on the draw period payment ($770) and assume repayment payment will be "slightly higher." They don't calculate that interest-only payments don't build equity, so the principal amount doesn't shrink.

Result: When principal repayment begins, the full principal is still due over the remaining term.

**Reason 2: Variable Rates Rising During Draw Period**
If you draw a $100,000 HELOC at 8.50% and rates rise to 10.50% over the next 10 years, your draw period payment increases. When repayment begins, your payment is even higher.

**Reason 3: Not Planning for Longer Repayment Terms**
A 15-year repayment period is standard, but some lenders allow 20 years. Spread $100,000 over 15 years vs. 20 years:
- 15 years: ~$1,093/month
- 20 years: ~$927/month

The longer repayment term lowers payment but you pay more total interest.

## Calculating Your Future HELOC Payment

Here's how to calculate what your repayment period payment will be:

**Step 1: Determine Your Draw Amount**
How much do you actually plan to borrow? Not the credit limit—the amount you'll actually draw.

Example: $100,000 drawn

**Step 2: Know Your Rate**
What's your HELOC rate at approval? Prime + your margin.

Example: 9.25%

**Step 3: Know Your Repayment Term**
How many years will you repay principal + interest? Ask the lender.

Example: 15 years (180 months)

**Step 4: Use the Loan Payment Formula**
Monthly payment = [P × r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
- P = Principal ($100,000)
- r = monthly rate (9.25% ÷ 12 = 0.00771)
- n = number of months (15 years × 12 = 180)

**Or Use an Online Calculator:**
Search "amortization calculator" and input:
- Loan amount: $100,000
- Interest rate: 9.25%
- Term: 15 years (180 months)

Result: **$1,093/month**

## The Payment Shock Scenario

Most borrowers experience this:

**Year 1–10 (Draw Period):**
- Balance drawn: Increases from $0 to $100,000
- Payment: Interest-only, typically $300–$800/month
- Mindset: "Easy, I can afford $500/month"

**Year 11–25 (Repayment Period):**
- Balance drawn: Fixed at $100,000
- Payment: Principal + interest, typically $900–$1,500/month
- Reality: "Wait, it jumped to $1,200/month? I can't afford this!"

Solution: Budget NOW for the higher repayment payment.

## Strategies to Avoid Payment Shock

**Strategy 1: Pay Principal During Draw Period**
Instead of minimum interest-only payments, pay extra toward principal.

Draw period, paying interest-only: $70/month
Draw period, paying principal too: $300/month

By repayment, principal is lower, so repayment payment is lower.

Example:
- If you pay $300/month for 10 years (instead of $70 interest-only), you've paid down $27,000 in principal
- Remaining balance: $73,000
- Repayment payment: $794/month instead of $1,093

Huge difference.

**Strategy 2: Convert to Full Amortization Before Repayment**
Some lenders let you start paying principal + interest during draw period.

Instead of waiting for repayment period, voluntarily switch to full amortization.

Draw period, converted to amortization: $1,093/month
Repayment period (if you'd waited): $1,093/month

No shock—payment is already locked in.

**Strategy 3: Use HELOC Short-Term Only**
If you only need HELOC funds for a few years, plan to pay it off before repayment period.

Example: Draw $100,000 at start of draw period, pay it off by year 7.

By year 10, balance is $0. No payment shock because you've already repaid.

**Strategy 4: Plan for Longer Repayment Terms**
If your lender offers 20-year repayment, choose that to lower the payment.

15-year repayment: $1,093/month
20-year repayment: $927/month

You pay more total interest ($67,000 vs. $59,000), but monthly budget is easier.

## HELOC vs. Home Equity Loan: Avoiding Shock

**Home Equity Loan:**
- Fixed payment from day 1
- No payment shock (payment is set)
- Can't borrow more later
- Best if you need predictable payments

**HELOC:**
- Low interest-only payments during draw
- High principal + interest payments during repayment
- Flexibility to borrow more
- Requires discipline to avoid shock

If you're terrified of payment shock, a home equity loan might be better. Fixed payment, no surprises.

## What to Ask Your Lender

1. **"What's the exact length of my draw period?"**
   5 years? 10 years? Lock it in writing.

2. **"What's the repayment period length I'm locked into?"**
   10 years? 15 years? 20 years?

3. **"Calculate my interest-only draw period payment?"**
   Get it in writing.

4. **"Calculate my principal + interest repayment period payment?"**
   Get it in writing so you can plan.

5. **"Can I convert to amortization early (before draw period ends)?"**
   Some lenders allow this for a fee.

6. **"What happens if I don't pay during repayment period?"**
   Can I extend repayment? What are fees?

7. **"Is there a balloon payment at the end?"**
   Most amortized HELOCs don't have balloons, but verify.

## Red Flags: HELOC Terms That Shock

**Vague Payment Terms**
Lender won't provide written calculation of repayment payment. Run away.

**Adjustable Repayment Period**
"We'll determine repayment term when draw period ends." This is lender discretion—you could get 10 years or 20 years. Get it locked in advance.

**Balloon Payments**
"Final payment of $50,000 due at end of repayment period." This is a lender mistake or scam. Avoid.

**Option to Extend Indefinitely**
"Keep drawing and making interest-only payments forever." Eventually, lenders come calling for repayment. No true "draw forever" HELOCs.

## Planning Your HELOC Exit

Think about how you'll handle repayment:

**Option A: Pay Down Principal During Draw Period**
Reduce the balance to lower repayment payments.

**Option B: Refinance at Repayment**
Take out a new loan (new mortgage or home equity loan) to pay off HELOC. Risky if rates are higher.

**Option C: Sell Home or Downsize**
Use proceeds to pay off HELOC. This is a major decision but eliminates the payment shock completely.

**Option D: Accept the Higher Payment**
Budget NOW for the higher repayment payment. Don't get shocked later.

Most borrowers should start with Option A: pay extra toward principal during draw period to minimize repayment shock.

## Ready for a Florida HELOC?

Understand that draw period payments are interest-only and low, but repayment period payments are principal + interest and much higher. Calculate your future repayment payment NOW, budget for it, and consider paying principal during draw period to soften the shock when repayment arrives.
