You have $150,000 in home equity. You need $80,000 for a kitchen renovation and have been considering your options. A lender suggests a cash-out refinance at a 6.75% fixed rate. Your bank offers a HELOC at Prime + 2% (currently 9.25%, variable). Which should you choose? Here's how to decide.

## HELOC vs. Cash-Out Refinance: The Core Differences

Both let you borrow against home equity, but they work completely differently.

**HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)**
- Keep your current mortgage intact
- Get a revolving credit line up to your equity
- Borrow flexibly, repay flexibly
- Variable interest rate (adjusts with Prime Rate)
- Two-phase structure: draw period, then repayment
- Lower closing costs (~$0–$500)
- Can quickly tap funds during emergencies

**Cash-Out Refinance**
- Replace your current mortgage with a larger one
- Get lump sum upfront, pay off existing mortgage
- Borrow specific amount at closing
- Can lock fixed rate (rate protection)
- Single amortization: pay for 30 years (typical)
- Higher closing costs ($3,000–$8,000)
- Proceeds disbursed at closing (no flexibility after)

## Rate Comparison: HELOC Variable vs. Refinance Fixed

This is the biggest strategic decision.

**Scenario: You need $80,000, currently pay 4.50% on mortgage**

**Option A: HELOC**
- Rate: Prime + 2.00% = 9.25% (currently)
- Draw period payment (interest-only): $617/month
- Repayment period (15 years): $758/month

**Option B: Cash-Out Refinance**
- New mortgage: $80,000 borrowed, existing $200,000 mortgage paid off
- New total mortgage: $280,000 at 6.75% fixed
- Combined payment (mortgage + previous): $1,848/month

Wait—that math doesn't work. Let me recalculate:

**If you refinance:**
- Current mortgage: $200,000 at 4.50% = $1,013/month
- Cash-out refinance: Borrow $80,000 (to add to $200,000) = $280,000 total at 6.75%
- New payment: $1,835/month
- Old payment: $1,013/month
- Increase: $822/month

**If you take HELOC instead:**
- Keep current mortgage: $200,000 at 4.50% = $1,013/month (unchanged)
- HELOC draw-period interest-only: $617/month
- Total payment: $1,630/month
- Increase: $617/month

HELOC is cheaper monthly! But HELOC rate could rise if Prime increases.

**Year 5 Scenario: Prime rises to 9.25% (rates rise generally)**

HELOC worst case:
- HELOC rate becomes: 9.25% + 2.00% = 11.25%
- Interest-only payment: $750/month
- Total with mortgage: $1,763/month

Refinance (already locked):
- Refinance rate: 6.75% (unchanged, fixed for 30 years)
- Total payment: $1,835/month (unchanged)

Refinance is cheaper now, but only because rates rose sharply. If rates fell, HELOC would be better.

## Cost Comparison: Closing Costs Matter

**HELOC Closing Costs**
- Appraisal: $400–$600 (sometimes waived)
- Title search: $200–$300
- Processing fee: $0–$300
- Underwriting: $0–$400
- **Total: $600–$1,600** (often $0 if promotional)

**Cash-Out Refinance Closing Costs**
- Appraisal: $400–$600
- Title search/insurance: $800–$1,500
- Loan origination: 0.5–1.5% of loan = $1,400–$4,200
- Processing/underwriting: $800–$1,500
- Recording fees: $200–$500
- Discount points (optional): $2,800–$4,200
- **Total: $5,600–$12,900** (often $8,000–$10,000)

HELOC is dramatically cheaper to open. Refinance closing costs are substantial.

## When to Choose a HELOC

Choose HELOC if:

**You Need Flexibility**
- You don't know exact amount you'll need
- Kitchen renovation might be $60,000 or $100,000
- You want to borrow gradually as work progresses
- HELOC lets you draw only what you need, only when you need it

**You Want to Keep Your Current Rate**
- You have a 4.50% mortgage and refinancing would bring you to 6.75%
- You don't want to reset your 30-year timer
- HELOC preserves your existing mortgage terms

**You Want Lower Closing Costs**
- HELOC costs $600–$1,600
- Refinance costs $8,000–$10,000
- If you only need $80,000 and refinancing costs $8,000, that's 10% of borrowed amount in fees

**You Might Pay It Off Quickly**
- You have a $50,000 bonus coming in 8 months
- HELOC lets you pay off debt early without penalty
- Refinance has prepayment penalties (on some loans)

**You Want Emergency Access**
- You keep HELOC open but unused until emergencies
- Provides liquidity safety net
- Refinance locks funds at closing (no flexibility)

## When to Choose a Cash-Out Refinance

Choose refinance if:

**You Need Large Lump Sum Now**
- You're renovating entire home ($150,000+)
- You need money immediately for construction
- Refinance gives full amount at closing
- HELOC requires waiting and gradual draws

**You Want Rate Stability**
- You lock 6.75% fixed for 30 years
- Rates might spike—you're protected
- HELOC rate will rise if Prime rises
- If rates are rising, locking fixed is smart

**You Want Predictable Payments**
- Refinance: Same payment every month for 30 years
- HELOC: Payment could rise 1% per year during draw, then jump 40% at repayment
- If you can't handle payment uncertainty, fixed refinance is better

**You Want to Reduce Overall Mortgage**
- You have $500,000 mortgage at 7% rate
- You refinance $450,000 at 6.75% rate
- You also borrow $80,000 cash (for home improvements)
- Total: $530,000 at 6.75% (slightly higher balance, lower rate = overall save)
- This only works if rates have dropped significantly

**You Can Offset Closing Costs with Savings**
- Refinance closing: $8,000
- Current rate: 5.50%, new rate: 4.50%
- Monthly savings: $150 × 12 = $1,800/year
- Break-even: 5.3 years
- If you're staying 10+ years, refinancing makes sense

## The Rate Risk Analysis

**If You Believe Rates Will Rise:**
- Lock the refinance rate NOW
- Get 30 years of rate protection at today's rate
- HELOC leaves you exposed to Prime increases

**If You Believe Rates Will Fall:**
- Take the HELOC at variable rate
- Benefit from Prime decreases
- Also benefit from lower overall monthly payments (HELOC cheaper monthly than refinance)

**If You're Uncertain About Rates:**
- HELOC gives flexibility (if rates drop, you save)
- Refinance gives certainty (if rates rise, you're protected)
- Choose based on your risk tolerance

## Tax Deduction Considerations

Interest on borrowed money is usually NOT tax-deductible. EXCEPT:

**If funds are used for home improvement:**
- HELOC interest may be tax-deductible (consult tax advisor)
- Refinance interest may be tax-deductible (consult tax advisor)
- Only the portion attributable to home improvement qualifies
- $80,000 HELOC for kitchen renovation = interest might be deductible
- $80,000 HELOC for debt consolidation = interest NOT deductible

**If funds are used for investment:**
- Investment property purchase: Interest IS deductible
- Stock/bond investments: Interest NOT deductible
- Consult a tax advisor before borrowing

## The Hybrid Approach: HELOC + Cash-Out Refinance

Some Florida homeowners do both:

**Scenario:**
- Current mortgage: $300,000 at 5% rate
- Home value: $500,000
- Home equity: $200,000
- Need: $100,000 now, might need $50,000 later

**Hybrid Strategy:**
- Cash-out refinance: Refinance $300,000 mortgage into $350,000 (get $50,000)
- Open HELOC: $150,000 credit line (keep open for future)
- Total new mortgage: $350,000 at 6.75% (replaces $300,000 at 5%)
- New HELOC: $150,000 available if needed

This gives you:
- Lump sum of $50,000 now (from refinance)
- $150,000 HELOC backup for future needs
- Only refinance once (instead of refinancing again later)

Downside: Refinance closing costs + HELOC closing costs.

## Comparing Monthly Payments

Let's do a realistic comparison:

**Scenario: Need $80,000**

**Current Situation:**
- Mortgage: $300,000 at 4.50% = $1,520/month

**Option 1: HELOC Only**
- Keep mortgage: $1,520/month
- HELOC draw-period interest-only: $617/month (at current 9.25%)
- Total: $2,137/month
- Repayment period (year 11+): $1,520 + $758 = $2,278/month

**Option 2: Cash-Out Refinance Only**
- New mortgage: $380,000 at 6.75% = $2,533/month
- Closing costs: $8,000 (rolled into loan or paid upfront)
- Total: $2,533/month

**Option 3: Hybrid (Refi $50,000 cash-out + $150,000 HELOC)**
- Refinanced mortgage: $350,000 at 6.75% = $2,335/month
- HELOC unused (no payment, emergency backup)
- Total: $2,335/month
- If you later need the $50,000 from HELOC: add $383/month interest-only

## Decision Matrix: Which to Choose

| Factor | HELOC Wins | Refinance Wins |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Lower monthly payment | ✓ (while rates stable) | |
| Rate certainty | | ✓ |
| Lower closing costs | ✓ | |
| Flexibility to borrow gradually | ✓ | |
| Predictable repayment | | ✓ |
| Simplicity | | ✓ |
| Emergency liquidity | ✓ | |
| Avoiding payment shock | | ✓ |

## Red Flags in Either Option

**HELOC Red Flags:**
- Lender won't disclose repayment period payment
- No written rate cap documentation
- Lender pressures you to draw maximum ASAP

**Refinance Red Flags:**
- Closing costs above $10,000 (might be excessive)
- Prepayment penalty (especially for 10+ years)
- Interest rate significantly higher than your current rate

## Ready to Choose Your Strategy?

Compare rates (HELOC margin vs. refinance fixed), calculate closing costs for each, and project 5-year and 10-year payments. HELOC is better for flexibility and low costs. Refinance is better for rate certainty and simplified payments. Your choice depends on your timeline, risk tolerance, and borrowing needs.
